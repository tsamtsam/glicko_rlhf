The quick rundown is that I don't live with my two dogs anymore so I have to make the most of the time that I see them.  When I visit, they get really excited for a few hours while I run around and play with them.  After a bit, they seem to get really bored and become super depressed.  The following days they just mope around bored and depressed -- they already know I'm around, it's not exciting anymore, they're just bored.  They don't even play with each other.

Occasionally I invent new games for them to play and it's pretty amazing.  I played the shell game with my older dog (his name is dante) and it was like he came alive for the first time.  After a few hours he was cheery straight through the next day, but after a few repeat games he got bored of that too.  I see them so rarely, I want to be able to keep them happy whenever I do show up.  Does anyone know of some unusual dog games?","The author is struggling with the transition of their dogs from a consistent, exciting routine to a more subdued existence.

Here's the original post: 

So, today was the day my wife actually moved out and is moving across the country. Over the last week and a half or so, I'd been dealing with a ton of emotions but I confided a great deal into a good friend of mine who helped me.

Today, I'm in a better place than I was 10 days ago. Heck, even better than I was just 4 days ago. Honestly, I was nearly at a point where I was going to try and convince my wife to actually stay instead, but my friend helped me right that train of thought and I think it was for the best.

So now, I'm about to get used to being alone for the first time ever. Not a big deal so far, just got a lot of cleaning up to do around the place and sorting of some of the things she left behind. 

I will say that our separation went smoother than I expected and we left on good terms, so I think. Our separation agreement was fair and left both of us content with the situation, so I'm grateful for that. 

Today, when she left, there were some tears. Not from me, though, but that isn't to say that I'm not sad. I cried already, but I'm starting to work my way back up from that low point. I also found a note while cleaning up that just said ""I love you"" on it, obviously written and stuck in a place that wasn't TOO obvious for me to find it. I do still love her, and I'm sure I will for a long time. Maybe, down the line, we can work out things and make the kind of changes it would take to get back together, but that isn't something I want to bother myself with right now. 

All in all, I'm in a content place and I'm excited for what the future holds. I've got some big plans on things I want to do for me that I haven't had the chance to do in the last 9 years, so I'm looking forward to diving headlong into that.

Thanks to everyone who left a comment on the first post and for all the well wishes. Things are looking up now, and hopefully they stay that way.","This post is about a man dealing with a difficult separation and expressing gratitude for the support he received.

Hi all,

First time caller, long time listener here. I bought a steak yesterday as part of my New Years resolution to learn more about cooking. Now, I know there are a hundred posts on here about how to cook a steak. The searing, the flipping, the finishing off in the oven, etc. I've read through a lot of them, however I've decided it to be a better idea for me to reach out for some more specific advice. 

I plan on cooking the steak this evening. It's a beautifully marbled 1.25"" - 1.5"" cut of boneless ribeye. I don't believe it was dry-aged. I was planning on going out this morning to purchase a Lodge 12"" Cast Iron Skillet to cook in seeing as they are pre-seasoned, but after a bit of research, it seems only right to re-season the pan. The problem with this is that the process would take hours and I may not have that kind of time. My other option is a run-of-the-mill 12"" frying pan with a plastic handle, which leaves the option of finishing the steak off in the oven out unless I want melted cookware.

As for the rest of the process, I plan on letting the steak come to room temp for about 40 - 60 min before salting and I've decided on salting immediately before searing. As far as the sear goes, I have vegetable oil and I have unsealed butter. I like the idea of cooking the steak in oil and finishing it off in butter a la Chef Ramsey, although I'm still up in the air on the flipping method. To flip once or constantly, that is the question! After much research and it being my first time with such a nice cut of meat, I'm leaning more towards the flip every 15 - 20 secs as opposed to 1 flip. The reason is that since I'm unfamiliar with cooking a steak of this proportion, I will be better able to gauge cook time and achieve a more even sear, since I'm not positive on how long to cook on each side with the one flip method.

So fellow redditors, what advice do you have for me? Any and all is welcomed. Thanks!","This post is a beginner's guide to cooking a ribeye steak, outlining their approach to searing, seasoning, and finishing.

My sister was in drug court for a drug charge she got almost 5 years ago. She has a 9 year old daughter. My sister and my niece had been living with her b/f who is in recovery and doing well.

so I am unsure if this is the correct subreddit for this! (or even if that is how you spell subreddit...) but I shall go on regardless! 

so basically this will be my last few years summarised in a neat and comic book esq flavour.

It all began in school, our hero discovered super powers for passing exams without any effort from his side! A's were flying everywhere, sure he was depressed but damn it he was passing everything with flying colours.

then came college, yet still he passed through it... scraping by on low grades but never actually failing anything!

so to university we fly! and then *BLAM* *POW* comes the double punch of hard work and mental disorders catching up on him (no coincidence there at all ;] ) so he is kicked out for not attending/failing courses

6 months later... the hero has applied for work all around but nothing can be found! he deals with customers poorly thanks to his fantastic mental prowess! the jobs that he is good at all need university qualifications and the few companies who provide training have a few zillion applicants.
the mental conditions are being dealt with through this clever thing called 'communication' and a few select choices of western medicine.
the social life is down the drain as his friends and girlfriend all got tired of his 'constantly being a downer' and so the hero is left with but one loyal side-kick
A return to university seems impossible for he is poor! from a lower class background! and only bursaries saved him last time!

Please read this. It's long. Reddit you are my only hope tonight. Forgive my hasty typing but I have had litter box house trained rabbits and know that setting a good precedent is important from the get-go. I got the ferrets two hours ago from a friend, getting rid of them because her boyfriend hated them. She seemed to have good intentions, however she didn't know shit about ferrets. Just like me. I know unspayed females can go into heat and it can cause a disorder that kills them. I asked if she'd spayed the female due to this and she laughed at me, said no, and told me she'd never heard of such a thing. Am I wrong? I'm flustered.
Here are the facts: The female is a white black eyed unspayed baby (less than a year old) The male is a ""regular?"" adult one. 2 years old? She said he is unscented. They need baths. They are friendly.
I want them to have free range of my basement and use a litterbox like my rabbits used to. I want to know how to train them. I like ferrets, I always wanted one, but everyone said ""They stink"" or thought they were creepy. I think they are cool...
Their cage was disgusting. I took it apart and put it in my shower and cleaned it. It's drying. The ferrets are running around in my empty guest bedroom. I gave them some toys and a blanket, and put a litterbox in two corners, (at first I put only one box in but found a ferret poo in the opposite corner?) and put out food and water. Please can you tell me what I need to know about getting along with these two critters? They also need baths but I have never bathed anything but a dog.

So I've recently got the internet hooked up in my new apartment, which I live in with my girlfriend. Since doing so I've spent most of my time when not working, on reddit. Ignoring my SO while doing so. So she was complaining saying ""Now you're never going to pay any attention to me"" and half jokingly I said ""well if you're on the front page of reddit I will"".

   She took this to heart made an account and a rage comic to try and do so, surprisingly it worked I noticed it and it meant a lot that she cared enough to do so. But she got really upset by the comments, people telling her she was probably not a girl, a karma whore, she should feel bad for making such a bad comic ect. I tried to explain that it was just a bunch of but-hurt bitches who cared about fake internet points a little too much but she said she didn't want to go on reddit anymore. 

   So I just wanted to make this self post to say fuck you all you fucking karma caring losers for scaring away a new reddit user that could have made a lot of you laugh with future comics and stories.
Also Thank you all of you who upvoted and said nice things of encouragement that also got her to the front page.

I'll stay because I know what reddit can be, but she wont and she might of even posted a picture to gonewild if she wasn't treated so badly for a comic(that quite frankly I've seen so many comics of people just ranting about shit in a comic just to get karma and no one says anything, those are far worse then her funny little story)","This post expresses frustration with a partner who has become overly invested in a Reddit community and is attempting to manipulate their girlfriend into doing the same, highlighting a concerning shift in the subreddit's culture and expressing a desire to distance themselves from the negativity.

Sorry, title sounded a little awkward but I guess it makes sense. So basically the other night the girl I've been sleeping with (call her F) regularly comes over and stays over, we have sex and then pass out before we have class the next day.

I have a really hard time sleeping, especially staying asleep, and so a lot of times I'll wake up, but F is a really sound sleeper and it never really bothers her. I remember waking up at least twice, and both times F was snuggled next to me, her head on my chest, but when I looked at her, it wasn't her. 

I'm in a fraternity and so we have sweethearts who are some of our best friends, but one of the things is that we absolutely CANNOT sleep with them or have sexual or romantic intimacy, since that would put the relationship between the girl and the entire chapter at risk. BUT, both times I woke up, I saw a different girl. Two of our sweethearts (call them S and B) both have a lot of physical similarities to F, all short brunettes who are cute, and so somewhere along the line of waking up I saw first B, then S, instead of F when I woke up. 

I loved it. I like F a lot, but we're just keeping things casual so we're not in a serious relationship or anything, but I spend so much time around S and B as friends, with no romantic or sexual stuff between us (except one time with S before she was a sweetheart). But, I can't act on the feelings I have towards either one, which is that some days I feel as though I might be in love with one or two of my best friends, and that maybe the girl that would be perfect for me is standing right there, and I can't do anything about it.

I just wanted to tell someone this, because obviously if I tell any of my brothers/other sweethearts shit might hit the fan and people would look at me differently.","This person is experiencing a situation where they have a sexual relationship with a friend (F) and are grappling with intense feelings for both of them, leading to a conflict with their fraternity's rules and a fear of jeopardizing their relationships.

Last night I experienced my first ever absolutely miserable run where instead of feeling energized and accomplished when it was over, I lay on my bathroom floor shivering and hugging the toilet. 

I have had frustrating runs before and I have had runs when my knee/ankle/toe hurt and made me want to quit but last night was far worse than any of those. 

Earlier in the day, I ate a sandwich and fell asleep on the couch for a two hour surprise nap. When I woke up my stomach was slightly unsettled like I was about to have heartburn. I decided to do out for my long run anyways because I always have heartburn and it doesn't usually stop me. This run was scheduled to be my longest yet at 1:30:00 (I am training for a half).

At about 45 minutes I started to get stomach cramps so I slowed how much water I was taking in. The entire run I had to walk several times which is unusual for me but my times were better than expected so I thought I was just pushing too hard and tried to take it easy on the way back. 

My post long run ritual is usually to drink several long drinks once I get back to the car since now I won't be jostling my innards around, I can do what I want. When I got home, I felt like I probably shouldn't try eating right away so I had about 1/3 bottle of Gatorade. 

Well...Gatorade was the wrong answer. Within 20 minutes I was violently heaving into my kitchen garbage and I lost all of the Gatorade and likely most of the water I had while running. 

My question is, do I blame my sandwich from earlier or my run? I am worried that 1:30:00 is my limit. I haven't considered quitting my half marathon training until now because everything up to this point has been fine.","This post describes a frustrating and unpleasant run experience, highlighting a significant issue with their running routine and a potential concern about their training schedule.

I am moving out to Colorado from Virginia in May and I intend on getting a dog, my first dog. I don't know much about dogs and will do a lot of research into training and the personalities of each specific breed but I'm looking for ideas for which breed to get.

Everyone has their favorite tricks/tips to keeping a clean house, so I'm curious...and in the market for a new vacuum and/or steam mop.

One thing I've noticed is that there are quite a few people here that follow certain percentage rules for buying cars, house, renting, etc.(name it and the rule is there).

Hokay, 

I was chilling out, maxin etc. listening to Mumford & Sons song ""After The Storm"" when I heard the lyrics ""Because death is just so full and man so small"" and for a split-second after that my brain was in overdrive and it felt like I had just gained the power to contemplate human existence, like a genuine shock.

I don't particularly like my job.  I also HATE the city I live in.  And I'm expecting my first kid early next year. No one in my line of work gets pregnant because it's a male dominated field.  They get their wives pregnant and then continue working long hours.

I'm considering quitting my job, selling the house, taking my emergency savings and moving close to my family where I could afford to pay cash for a new home similar to the one I'm in.  The problem is my job title is practically non-existent back home unless I start up my own gig, which would make this future motherhood thing much easier if I could work from home.

If I do this, I need to consider that my start-up might take a year or two to take off.  In which case, I'm looking for some reliable investment income that would just pay the bills and health insurance, let's say $2400 a month.  I'm planning on buying a couple properties to rent out, but I want to be sure to diversify with the additional funds I have.  Is it even realistic to think I can generate $1000+/ monthly from stocks/bonds/etc. if I were to invest only $50k?

Up until now I've been playing around on etrade like it's vegas... investing a little here, getting back a little there.  So far my 5 month return has only been $4k, but that was with only an $8k starting investment, and since I didn't know much I kind of feel I just got lucky.

Hello /r/pets;

I have a little lady named [Franklyn Weatherbee] We rescued her very young after she was found under my friends truck. We think she was about 2-3 weeks old, she barely had teeth, bright blue eyes and was about a 1/2lb. Now she is almost three months, and has been wonderful. Super sweet, mostly a good little thing, and I've grown to think she is fantastic. 

Earlier tonight, she went to chew on something and meeped a little. She then spent some time walking around, sad meowing, pawing a little at her mouth and licking like something was stuck in her teeth. It freaked me out, but she stopped after a few and seemed fine, until she tried to eat some dinner (wet food). Same thing again, sad mews, weird licking, seemingly in pain. She wouldn't let me look in her mouth, which is weird because she usually doesn't care. 

My boyfriend thinks she is teething, and that it is worse because she was orphaned at such a young age. Does anyone have any knowledge on this? We're taking her to the vet first thing in the morning, but I'm quite worried and am curious as to what you all think, since you've been so great in the past. Thank you!","This post is about a rescue dog named Franklyn Weatherbee, who has been thriving and seems to be experiencing unusual behavior.

When I had my heart transplant i was 12. I remember I was always tired and i can't breath properly so my mother took me to the ospital. We found out that my heart was larger than normal, they put me on transplant list and 3 weeks later there was an heart available for me.
Now I'm 23 and I almost spent the majority of my life with a new heart. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes i feel like it's an heavy bag on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel guilty, because when i was sick i prayed for a new heart (and it means that i prayed that a child would die to take me alive).

I've had way too much time on my hands lately, and have been in a weird state of mind in general. I've been using the internet since the 90's, but I'm in no way saying that I'm some kind of veteran-hipster of interweb depravity. I would consider myself a general user. 

On reddit and other social networking sites, there is a lot of hate and conflict- I think this is because people are terrified. We are terrified of being so close to the inner thoughts of an infinite number of minds. We have been abruptly thrust into a new age of total mental nakedness, living without privacy, and the anonymity factor just adds to the chaos and panic. It's scary, exhilarating and a huge leap in our society as a planet.

What I want to get off my chest is this: I love it. I love the hive mind, the good and the bad shit, the trolls, the psycho tumblr users, the wanna-be porn stars, the karma whores and every anonymous rambler.

I work for a huge technical company.  I was just promoted to Technical Lead or Engineer III in October.  The excitement was short lived though.  3 weeks later they announced they were closing my facility.  Now I went from elation to depression.  Sure, I could relocate but that really is not an option for me and my family at this point.  There are no other job prospects in this area to make any where near the money I was. What do I do?

My family has tried literally EVERYTHING to control the fleas in our neighborhood (Frontline, Advantage, Diatomaceous Earth, Dawn Dishsoap, etc!) and nothing has worked. I have spoken to lots of pet owners in my area (I work as a vet assistant) and many are reporting similar results, where fleas are becoming resistant to the usually recommended treatments. The only thing that has worked so far is Comfortis, but I've read of several dogs having reactions to it that can be pretty severe. My dogs are fine, we've used it for about a year now, but I don't like the idea of harming them or putting them at risk. 

Giving them baths with blue Dawn dish soap does kill all the fleas, but it does nothing to prevent more from coming back, obviously. It only kills on contact, and we are NOT going to over bath them because that isn't healthy either. We're looking for something that lasts.

Noticed around noon that my greyhound had two tiny lumps within her mouth, and by 2pm they had swollen up to about the size of a golf ball. We took her to the emergency vet since our regular one was booked for the day, and they told us basically just to keep her on the Rimadyl and Tramadol she was already on and there was nothing they could do without surgery.  
I'm a little concerned; they said she'd be fine until we were able to take her the our normal vet on Monday, but the medicine doesn't seem to be doing anything and her mouth is just as swollen as it was before. The vet seemed very rushed and mostly just looked at her bloodwork and that was it. Is there a way they could drain some of the fluid to make her more comfortable?

I am in a rut. My family decided to go Chengdu recently but threw all the planning matters to me, and I am in a lost of what is Chengdu like other than hotter than sin hotpots and an other worldly location in Jiuzhaigou.

Here's the plan:
3 days Chengdu. No idea what locations to visit. I browse thru sites at Tripadvisor. Personally I think I will choose Jinli, Hakka Village. Somewhere unique but not too ""fake"". My parents unfortunately has a rather bad experience in Kyoto and they would like it if its not full of ""UNESCO"" heritage stuff but scenery is way too manufactured (I know, quite a controversial opinion but it makes my dad refuses to go to Tokyo this year even if he never been there). And some nice food. My dad's quite picky and quite unpredictable with food taste but he does like non-oily food. He is quite contradictory when it comes to oily food.

There is a talk of going Hailuogou. We have never been in a glacier and in short term are not likely to go to anything similar but our aunt recommend us to go there. Personally it sounds great to me.

3 days JiuZhaiGou - We are not going to Huanglong or WenChuan (we really dont want to), but straight away to JiuzhaiGou by flight. Will it be feasible to go in 3 days? What are the things I should take care of? By the way Jiuzhaigu is a compulsory for the trip.

2 days Chengdu.If we are going Hailuogou then we will go to the places mentioned above.

All of my family speak Chinese so languages shouldn't be a concern. Should we get a guide in Chengdu/hailuogou or Jiuzhaigou? My dad is disabled so he's our primary concern. He is perfectly willing to shell out money for transport/stay in hotel if the place is too dangerous, but we will like it if he can participate with us if not all of the time.","This post is a traveler expressing their frustration with their family's impulsive travel plans in Chengdu, seeking advice on what to prioritize and how to navigate the city, including Hailuogou and Jiuzhaigou, while considering their dad's dietary restrictions","The author is experiencing a rut in Chengdu and feels overwhelmed by the city's heat and a lack of unique experiences.

I didn't know what I was doing when I got this card, and I definitely over-spent (my ignorance, they approved me for $2500). The reasoning for why I spent that much is irrelevant for this discussion.

Reddit, I don't know where to start, but I'll begin by telling you that I have very recently been brutally honest with myself and it made me cry for ten minutes straight. 

I love attention, and because I am a very outgoing attractive girl, I garner a lot of it. I'm used to guys watching me walk by on the street,  women looking at me with envy or judgement, and people listening to what I have to say when I talk. *Please, please*, don't see this as a conceited statement, I'm just laying groundwork here.

Regardless of the attention I receive, the knowledge of my beauty and intelligence, there is *still* so much insecurity. So what do I do? I get a boyfriend and things always seem to accelerate super quickly.  We move in together in the first couple of months or the ""L"" word is spoken (I hate to say it but my bf at the time is usually the first to), excessive amounts of time is spent together and when I think everything is going fine, **boom** the relationship dissolves and I'm left with myself.  

I used to write, words were my art. Fashion was something I was so passionate about and I had a stronger sense of self than I do now. I look in the mirror sometimes and don't know who I am (as cliche as it sounds.) I live in a suburban town (though I am close to a city) and I don't have any friends because they have all floated away in the midst of my relationships. When people ask me what I like to do for fun or what my hobbies are, I draw a complete blank. When I pick up a pen to write, I feel uninspired. 

I know, in my head and now in my heart, that the only way to figure myself out is to be without a bf, but that safety and comfort of always being wanted by one specific person will be gone, and it scares me to death.","This person is struggling with a cycle of fleeting attention, insecurity, and relationship instability, feeling lost and disconnected from their own identity and interests.

So for 60 months I'm paying $574 per month on this car - I can afford it, but it's at the point where with everything I make enough to pay my bills and not really a lot of room to put much money at all away in savings.

As of right now I have 42 payments left on the car. I added everything up and it basically means so far I have been paying for the interest on this car loan and still owe more than what the car was even worth new. The car is a 2009 Kia Sportage that I bought for around $22,000 with an APR that was around 20%.

I'd like to get to the point where I can easily pay $250-300 per month if possible.

What should I do? Can I refinance it successfully? Should I look into trading off the car and trying to get a used one? If I refinance is there any recommendations on how to do that process?","This person has a bad credit history and a car loan with a high interest rate, struggling to make payments and facing a significant amount of debt.

Our rescue cat, Abby, has always been picky with food. When we first got her, she was quite ill and didn't like to eat anyway so that was even more difficult. Every time we think she likes a food, she stops eating it within a week and won't eat it again (Only after we have bought a months supply...).  

The thing is, we've tried to out-stubborn the cat, and it was a game of chicken we were never going to win.  And then came kitty number two, Ollie, who is just the jabba the hutt of kitties.

Not only will Ollie eat any left over food in Abby's bowl, but Abby doesn't want it and actively gives it to her baby sister.  It got so bad that Abby was vomiting clear bile out of hunger at night... we tried separating them, getting new foods, giving dry food to snack on... it was no use, she didn't eat. Before anyone asks, she HAS been to the vet and they just said she's picky.

Fast forward to us getting a gift pack from our vet for the baby when we took Abby in to see if there is a problem. It has royal canin weaning kitty food, and we thought we'd see if Ollie liked it. Guess who likes it? Abby. It is kitty crack cocaine I don't know. We started sprinkling it on top of normal cat food, and guess what.. she eats it. It's like a seasoning.

So here is our doubt, is this ok to do? The vet seemed really passive about it, and I don't know how good this is to do. I looked up its ingredients and it almost seems just like a vitamin packed dry food. We are sprinkling so she doesn't eat more than a a few grams.","This post describes a cat named Abby who has a severe picky eating habit, has a very demanding sibling, and has been subjected to a bizarre experiment with a vitamin-packed dry food.

r/college, I'm a natural introvert.  I don't really have much in common with my generation.  I don't like rap, I can't dance for shit, and I don't really like the taste of alcohol.  Add some social anxiety to that and you've got my current situation.

I'm a month into college, and for four Fridays and Saturdays, I've sat in my dorm room doing absolutely nothing.  Browsing Reddit, playing Xbox by myself, usually offline (the wifi is spotty on the 12th floor), things like that.  I look all around me and see people connecting.  I have made two or three friends while I've been here, but the awkwardness and hesitation plays into me not really actively trying to hang out with them.  I'm usually okay on my own, but lately I've been feeling kinda lonely.  I really don't know how to push myself to go do things or meet people I don't expect to have anything in common with.  

Is there anything I can do?  I WANT to meet people.  I WANT to find someone who I really do connect with.  College is usually the place to do that, but it seems I'm not doing well with it.  Part of the reason I feel so isolated is because my major is Language Studies and I want to get into the JET program to teach English in Japan, which inevitably means I'd be leaving the States after college.

So my wife and I are about 4 years out of college, we have about $23k in loans still to pay. About $7k of that has an interest rate of 6.2ish% then rest is under 3%.

This is a wall of text, so I apologise in advance. 

My 12 year old fox terrier (standard size) has had a nagging cough since March of this year. At first it seemed a random cough and we chalked it up to old age. 

Recently it has become more persistant.  We can't seem to find a pattern, except it does seem to happen more often after he poops. It doesn't seem to matter if his motions are soft or hard.  He has always strained when pooping, mainly in his neck and back legs.  

Rarely, he will cough up a thick white phlegm.  This is not common, but its disturbing when he does. 

We have taken him to our Vet, and they did X-rays, blood tests and a urine sample. Confirmed he does not have kennel cough, cancer, a collapsed airway or any tumors or growths in his throat.  We are given a course of antibiotics (7 day) that slightly lessened the cough. $900 later we are told he is perfectly healthy and sent home.  This was in June, and ever since it is clear he is not perfectly healthy.  

He is an indoor and outdoor dog.  He sleeps, and eats mainly in the house. He spends some of the day and does his business outside. We have one other dog (field spaniel) and two cats (one short hair, one long hair).  The other animals are 10, 6 and 4 years old respectively. They have been around since before the cough so we dont believe it is their fur or dander he is reacting too, especially as the cough is not as common when he is indoors. 

Basically, I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this with a pet? What was the outcome? What should I be asking Vet's to check for? I am considering taking him to the Veterinary School at SydUni, simply because I cant afford another $900 only to be sent away being told he is fine.  Still, I hate seeing him this way. 

Thank you for any help or suggestions you can offer. Also, I do apologise for any spelling or grammar mistakes, its been a long day.","This post is a discussion about a 12-year-old fox terrier experiencing a persistent cough and a thick white phlegm.

Okay so, in January 2012, I ended up in the ER two days in a row while my entire family was at Disney World. Fast forward a few months, I recall the bill coming to my parents' house, and receiving it when I came home from college at some point. My parents have never been very good with money. Countless months with our water, power, phones shut off. Last year, the bank took our house. It wouldn't be far fetched to imagine a situation in which my parents conveniently misplaced this bill.

Being the naive 19 year old that I was at the time, I assumed my parents would take care of it. As I've come to learn being a much more responsible and **slightly** less naive 22 year old, my parents let the two medical bills (totaling $1700) go to collections. I found this out when I checked my credit for the first time (suggested by a finance professor) around the beginning of last month.

I talked to the collection agency, which is based in the city that I live in, and as suggested by my own mother I set up a payment plan. I have already paid ~$700 of this debt. As of yesterday, I get a call from my mother who urges me not to pay any more money because I had insurance at the time and it should have been covered. Now, my father is attempting to contact his former employer to process an old bill.

My question is: If by some miracle this does happen to work out, what is the likelihood that I would be able to get the money back that I have already paid?

Oh and, like an idiot, I was intimidated when they already had all of my information, and gave them authorization to withdraw the money from my account.","This individual experienced a series of unfortunate events – a medical emergency, a house foreclosure, and a collection agency dispute – and has now begun to pay off a significant debt.

Let me preface this by stating that I know virtually nothing about investing/the stock market, and I have unfortunately not been faced with ""real life"" yet, therefore I am not too great with money management--but I'm trying.

I am a recent college graduate (graduated with zero student debt) who is currently unemployed. I have an unpaid internship lined up with very good prospects that it will turn into a paid position after I complete it, and am actively searching for other part-time work to supplement income in the mean time. I am currently living off of a monthly allowance that my parents send me until I secure a job (covers rent and utilities, but barely any left over). I have about ~$800 in credit card debt due to me being financially stupid.

Recently I remembered that as a child my parents set aside about 2k in (I think) a Charles Schwab account for me to ""invest,"" but really didn't offer much guidance and it's never actively been invested. I know it existed in my name, but the last time I spoke to my parents about it I was probably ~15 years old (my dad gave me some papers about it, but I don't know where they are).

Anyways, my goal this year is to become fully self-sufficient and pay off my credit card debt in full, as well as building savings and being overall more financially intelligent. 

My question is, should I seek out this 2k and use it to pay off my credit debt? I considered withdrawing it all (I've inquired to my dad regarding getting more information about it), paying off my debt, taking care of some car repairs I've been putting off, and then starting a savings/emergency fund.

First, my apologies if this has been answered before. I couldn't find any reference to this here on Reddit nor on Google.

So back in 2009 I had just heard about backdoor Roth IRA conversions, which would help me because I had an AGI north of $150k. I opened a new Traditional IRA Account with Vanguard and made 3 non-deductible contributions to it between April 14 2009 and January 2 2010 (covering CY 2008 ($3k), 2009 ($5k) and 2010 ($5k)).

Around January 2010 I did a backdoor conversion from my Vanguard Traditional IRA to a brand new Vanguard Roth IRA. The total was around $13700.

Around May 2010 I rolled around $50k from a 401k I had with a previous employer to my Vanguard Traditional IRA.

When I did my taxes for 2010, my accountant said I would be subject to the pro-rating since I had ""mixed"" pre-tax and post-tax money in my Traditional IRA. Even though the balance of my Vanguard Traditional IRA was 0 between January and May of 2010, he said because the account had contained both pre-tax and post-tax money in the same calendar year, the IRS considers the money ""mixed"". I took his word for it at the time, but after reading tons of articles on backdoor Roth IRAs, I've started to wonder if he was correct.

Does anyone have any information on if this is true or not? I tried reading the instructions for form 8606 and it makes my head hurt. Any clarification or links to where the IRS addresses this would be most helpful.

Hi All,

For most of my life I've been slated to give my brother a kidney. We've always joked about it and never really thought of it too seriously, but now that day is close.

Yeah, so I missed a call from him earlier. When I called back he said he'd call me back in a bit. So I'm farting around, looking for something to do. Watched TV in the basement for a short time and went back upstairs. I was chilling in my bed, messing with my phone when he called. He asked if he could run something by me and I asked if it was beer because I was out of beer. We decided that I'd just go over to his house so I could drink his beer and he could run something by me. When I went outside, I smelled something burning. Not just *something* burning, but it smelled like cigarette butts burning. I had recently smoked a cigarette on the back porch and outside the basement door, so I went to check. Nothing happening on the back porch, but there was a softball size glowing red wad of cigarette butts where I put my cigarette out about 10-15 minutes earlier. I realize now how unsafe our ""ash tray"" is now because it is just a flimsy plastic thing that a plant would come in, it was over stuffed with cigarette butts AND it was sitting in a bed of pine straw! So I grab the hose and easily extinguish this glowing butt fireball of death and breathe a sigh of relief.

So who knows what would have happened if I hadn't decided to go to my friends house at about that time. I would've come outside within the next half hour or so to smoke, an hour at the most and would have smelled it then if it was still smoldering. But like I said, it was a glowing ball of death in a bed of pine straw, so it could have easily ignited and then who knows what would have happened.

Oh, and my wife is out of town. Imagine making that call. Honey, umm, I uh, I burned the house down. *shiver* Can't even think about the fact that all 4 of my kids were home at this time.

Hi. I've been working for over a year now and managed to save a decent amount of money (20k+). I currently still live with the parents, therefore don't pay a huge amount for rent etc hence why I'm able to save so efficiently. Also because I don't waste money on stuff I consider unnecessary (partying etc).

Well anyway. I'm currently working a pretty cool job, though, it is getting a bit boring and I want to start my apprenticeship in a civil trade next year as my current job has barely any opportunities for the future. My plan is to move city next year and start my apprenticeship, which obviously would cost more in living expenses.

Hi guys! I am a future freshman from Europe (I am a male and I will study in the US) at a tech school. Although I am smart, I am not very geeky (actually not at all) and I like to have fun. I am not into wild parties every night, but one every weekend (or at least every couple of weekends) is a priority for me. These are my problems:

* Tech school students are not that much into partying
* I am international so I basically have no idea how to be cool with Americans
* (because of these two) I don't know how to find the wright people to hang out with (geeks --- wright people --- wild animals)
* I heard that some weirdos rat people for no good reason, like drinking a beer in the room or coming back from a party drunk, and this may seem like no big deal to citizens, but I am on visa and they will find any reason to kick me out, so how do I stay away from those guys
* (Q) are there places where each type of students usually hang out?

Could you give me advice on how to deal with these problems and stay away from the dark side at the same time?

I'm studying film in college and have many lecturers, who teach all aspects of the creation of film and television, all wonderfully relevant lecturers. But we have one class which is dubbed Philisophical Tradition and our lecturer seems to get kicks out of making our class as vague as he can, with as little link to reality as possible. Take for example my notes from our last class which simply say: ""Freud. Noses are the link? Use dreams as example."" Utter madness.

I've always said I'm a resilient person. I'm a strong woman. But I've been through a lot of hell in my short adult life.
I thought I was ready to move on after what had happened to me 6 months ago. Apparently, what they said about this sticking with me for life was true. The concept of a normal relationship seems too far gone for me now that I'm a different person. I was raped. And I've been trying to reclaim my life for 6 months.

That's not the beginning though. For 3 years I was in an emotionally, physically and sexually abusing relationship. Following that I spent another year with someone who sexually abused me. I was so done with being abused that I had a one night stand, believing that it was my chance to take ownership of my own body. It wasn't until a stranger raped me that I finally understood how fucked up my sex life had been. 

Now that I'm dealing with the aftermath of my rape, I'm unsure of where to go. I had two friends with benefits, both ending badly. One became my best friend and the other tried too hard to get me in his pants. I finally found the strength to tell him no. 

It's been a long journey, but it turns out that the first person I fell into after my rape was the first person to even attempt understanding me. I fell in love with him, and I still am. He treated me like I was more than a body. He started out as a friends with benefits, but the moment he saw how scarred I was - something he noticed before even I did - he assumed the role of my best friend. For that I am forever grateful.

Recently I fell into a new friendship that took a wrong turn. We had sex. Or do I even call it that? I didn't have the heart to say no. I don't know if I've ever been able to say no, after the first guy took advantage of me. I just assumed that any man who took the time to touch me had owned me.

I'm ready to stand up for myself and stop giving my body up to people who take it for granted. It's my body. 

Where do I begin to take a stand?","This post expresses a complex and deeply painful history of abuse, including rape and a series of abusive relationships.

Just wanted to pass this info along to anyone else who, like me, wouldn't have known otherwise. 

I have a US passport. I planned a 3 week trip through Europe, scheduled all my flights and stays in between, researched places to see and things to eat, read blogs and watched videos, packed my bags and double checked to make sure I had everything, showed up at the airport yesterday, and was promptly denied because my return date was 2.5 months before my passport expired. 

To travel to Europe, my return date has to be 3 months before expiration. My passport expired before the stated expiration date.

I was disappointed and so sad. Thankfully my friends who were seeing me off came back to pick me up, I made an appointment with the passport agency (earliest one is for Thursday) and rescheduled my trip to Friday. I'm hoping and praying that passport turn around is same day as some people have told me, otherwise my entire trip is doomed. 

So because I thought my passport expired on the day of expiration, my three weeks got cut to 2 weeks. I've rescheduled, dropped 2 countries from my travel list, and am sitting at home with nothing to do, a cleaned out fridge, and moping for an entire week... 

I wish I had checked and known about this passport thing, and I'm disappointed in myself and in the system in general for such a maddening rule. 

I hope you wonderful Travellers out there learn from my mistake.

Hello r/personalfinance, long time listener, first time caller. I'm not entirely sure this is the right place to post this, but as I peruse here quite a bit I thought it would be worth a shot.

The backstory: in June I got a very sore tooth treated with a root canal. The dentist supposedly removed the roots and filled my tooth with a temporary filling. They told me to come back in a week to complete the next step but could not get me in for a month. I went back and they said I had a lot of bacteria and to come back in another month after a course of antibiotics. I came back again a month later and they said it was bleeding excessively and had to drain, so I should come back in another month. At this point I was moving out of state in a week and told them so, and they essentially showed me the door. After moving, I went to another dentist who did an x-ray and said the tooth was severely decayed and needed extraction. I did experience some pain in the days leading up to the extraction and the oral surgeon told me there was still some root tissue in the supposedly completed root canal causing me pain, which isn't entirely unheard but worth noting.

Alright, the part I need advice on: just yesterday, I received a bill in the mail from my former dentist for $300. I called to ask what this was for and they said the insurance company wouldn't cover the incomplete procedure. I find it very interesting that I got a bill for this in November, months after my business with them had ended. I also heard nothing from the dentist at the time saying I would have to pay for an incomplete procedure. I called the insurance company and they said to have the dentist send them x-rays and other stuff, but I'm really doubtful that will do much for me.","This person experienced a significant dental issue with a root canal and subsequent complications, including a bill for an incomplete procedure and a concern about the root tissue.

I have acquaintances, but no other *actual* friends. I have been best friends with A (I'll call her that here) for almost 10 years. I think because her parents are pretty cold to her, A feels like she needs to belittle others so she can feel better about herself. Ever since we've met she has been like this, but for some reason I'm only just recently realizing that she might be one of the greater reasons I have no real friends. (She also has no real friends... Basically all we have is each other and our boyfriends. But that's it.)

My thoughts on this are that since she is always talking shit about everyone, other people over the years must think that I am like that too. Which I will admit, after having been around A for so much of my life, some of her negative traits have rubbed off on me, like her negative views on life and pessimism in general.

Aside from my monthly bills, I contribute to a 529 plan for my daughter, term life insurance, and a retirement fund.  I budget for my expenses very carefully and usually only leave myself a little bit of wiggle room for incidentals and a little for entertainment.

I had a couple of expenses that went through the other day that just so happened to leave me with exactly a $0 balance in my checking account.  I knew I didn't have anything else that should be hitting my bank until I get paid on the 1st so I figured I'd just let it ride and transfer money in should the need arise.  

I had to write a check today for an unexpected expense and immediately went online to transfer money in to cover it, but my bank had closed my checking account!!  I was completely surprised!  They wouldn't let me do a transfer and claimed that I would have to go into a branch and make a cash deposit and told me that even then it could take 3 business days to open the account back up.

About 9:00 last night, sitting in my usual spot watching some TV with the wife and about to fire up a game. All of a sudden we hear a short horn honk, sounds really close, as in it came from one of our cars parked in the driveway. I throw everything on the floor and run to the window and see someone running across my yard away from our cars. I grab my keys and run outside and this guy is next door and looks back over his shoulder at me and hauls ass. I go check out my car and sure enough, every compartment is open and shit is everywhere. 

I get in and take out after him. Knowing the shitty apartments nearby, I figure that's the best direction to head. Turn a couple of corners and I see him hop a fence into a gated apartment complex. This whole time I'm on the phone with a 911 dispatcher giving them information. I pull up to the fence where he jumped it and hit my bright lights, he's gone and there's no way for me to continue the chase. 

Two hours later the cops show up and take all my information and file a report. Fast forward to this morning as I'm driving to work. I look into my neighbors yard where the guy was. There's a huge culvert that runs through their front yard, kind of a dry creek. On the bank of that is a white shirt. I call my wife and she goes out to check it out and also sees an ID card laying there for some trade school. 

So I call the cops to let them know about these items. They sent a unit by. Cop starts looking around and comes across the guys social security card, a few seconds later he finds his drivers license.

From what I understand the 401(k) allows you to select a portion of your income to be put aside while being tax exempt and sometimes an employer may offer to ""match up"" the amount you put in.

How does the 401(k) money grow? Can you invest the money in the fund? Does the employer offer a rate or is the ""match up"" amount the only amount you get?

If this being the case wouldn't it be much better in the long term to invest in stocks as historically the stock market is said to have a 10-11% growth on average (so no doubt there would be ridiculous downs and ups in between a few decades).

OK so I've never been good with money, it makes my toes curl to think I'm 26 years old and have earned circa £120,000 in my life and have literally nothing to show for it except a string of nasty hangovers and some cool stories. 

I recently got back from doing some charity work abroad and have landed a pretty well paid job. £20,000 basic salary with uncapped commission.

I have a chronic pain condition so sometimes my ability to train can be affected. However, I'm fed up of being what I consider 'slow' as I know if I knew how to train, I could take a lot off my times.

**5k** - Target: 00:20:00 - Current race PB: 00:24:28

**5 mile** - Target: 00:33:06 - Not raced before

**10k** - Target: 00:41:41 - Current race PB: 00:51:13

**10 mile** - Target: 01:09:02 - Not raced before

**Half** - Target: 01:32:00 - Current Race PB: 02:02:47

**Marathon** - Target: 03:11:49 - Not raced before

Are these targets realistic for 12 months time?

I have lived thousands of miles and several timezones away from friends and family, in a totally different culture, where to understand the local language you need to learn three new alphabets, but now that I am back in my home country and considering moving away from the big city and my hometown (to somewhere quieter, to do something less stressful), I am finding it hard to overcome anxiety and actually make the move.

I have travelled alone for several months in far away places, taken risks like leaving a stable job to work as a tour guide, but since a traumatic experience at the end of my time overseas, I have been experiencing anxiety.  

I have never experienced this kind of generalised anxiety before.  Previously I would have embarked on this kind of move knowing that there were risks but also that it was worth the effort.  

I came back with some savings and wanted to give myself a break since my time abroad was a bit intense and my job when I came back was not at all interesting.  I have already left the job but now each day that I don't do anything it's very frustrating and hard not to become negative and feel stuck (trapped).

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this and I am sure there is a different way of looking at it.  I am looking for examples of how you may have overcome this kind of situation.

Thanks for reading.","This post expresses a person's struggle with anxiety and a desire to move away from a stressful situation, stemming from a traumatic experience abroad.

Obviously there's context here.  Things like a frozen pipe that bursts in the winter are clearly an emergency.

But there's a lot of things I'm not sure how to classify.  There are lots of costs of home ownership I *know* I will have to incur, although maybe not *when* I have to pay for them, such as:

* Furnace replacement
* Re-roofing the house
* Replacing major appliances (washer, dryer, etc)

Do these things count?  Or should I be saving separately for this?

I ask, because I'm finding myself a bit spread thin; I have money auto-deducted from my paycheque that goes to building my emergency fund, savings for my annual gym membership, my RSPs (I'm Canadian - this is like IRAs), my pension, etc.

I started my current job as a PT position while in high school. It's in the field of media and video production which I loved growing up. Attended some college while working at my job, but college didn't feel right for me and I dropped out. I've been employed at my job now since 2006. Over the years, as the pay and responsibility increased, I have found myself transitioned into what is essentially a very mundane and monotonous desk job doing programming and transcoding of media files for 40 hours a week, where before I obtained this higher level position, it was mainly creative projects and generating original media for the company which I had control of.

I am now 26 y/o and extremely unhappy in my current position, have that ""stuck"" feeling, and no longer get along well with my superior and it affects my mood outside of work around my family. It's mentally eating me up inside and I really want a change in my life toward employment in a field that will be more active, rather than being at a desk in a windowless room. 

The problem is, I make $18/hr (which for me personally is a good sum of money that takes care of the bills and most of whatever else i need) and my health insurance/benefits are fantastic. I've been dealing with the mental stress of this job for a year or two since losing interest and motivation, but feel chained to it because I don't think I'll find similar-paying gainful employment elsewhere due to my lack of education and specific set of skills. 

Does anyone have any pro life tips for me to conquer this? Do I reinvent myself from the inside to accept the fact that I'm lucky to be employed at all and try to quell back the sadness, or do I reinvent myself by setting a hard quit date say 8 months from now while I work on seeking new skills?

So, stuff like this pops up around reddit all of the time. I have seen it with my own eyes, but I want to get this off of my chest.

I was dating this girl for awhile, about a year and a month or two. We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we ""broke up,"" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. 

This semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.

This girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...

It has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer). I am worried about my old friends, my new friends (which she feels she has claim to) and just my happiness in general. I still love this girl a little, but I mostly just want to move on. I want to see new people get more experience.","This woman has been a difficult relationship with a history of inconsistent behavior and a tendency to be flighty.

Sorry in advance for any bad grammar or typos, using my phone.

My wife and I are in the process of buying a house (and are currently under contract). The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.

Fast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).

I spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.

Now, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).

I don't know how to feel or what to think. Maybe we're overreacting? My wife is more disturbed over the situation then I am, but I still feel unrest. Any and all advice or constructive criticism is welcome. Are we right to feel this way? Or should we just try to brush it under the rug, so to speak?","This post is a difficult situation involving a deceased seller in a newly rebuilt house.

I have a four year old Cairn Terrier, and for the first year and a half of his life, he was perfectly fine around other dogs. I would even have friends bring their dogs into my house, and he would be fine. I went back to school for my senior year of college, and when I came home for break, my mother explained that he just growls and snaps at other dogs whenever he sees them.

Since the summer, when I started going to the gym warming up for weightlifting with 10-12 minute hard runs on the treadmill, I've seen my average pace go from 7:00/km down to between 6:10 and 6:20. On sunday, perhaps because it was frigid and pissing rain, I gave her as hard as I ever have over a prolonged period and finished the James Run 10k in Peterborough Ontario with a 59:22-- a hell of a drop since my last 10k, which I ran in 1:08.

Hi, long time owner of cats, parents got cats and I am really used to them, I own now a castrated male 4 year old persian. My daugther is almost one year old and she usually tries to catch him removing some of his hair and sometimes the cat answers and has made her some tiny scratches, nothing that would worry me up since the cat is always inside the house and I don't fear it would give her some kind of illness.

The problem came today, my daughter was softly caressing him (sometimes she does) and the cat started hissing at her, I came just quick and took the cat apart, that was this morning and not (afternoon here in Spain) the cat hasn´t stopped hissing at any of us, my wife and my daughter just got to have lunch with some friends and I'm staying with the cat.

If I stay still seated on one place the cat will calm down and relax where he can watches me, as soon as I walk he runs by me starts hissing at me, even scratched me on the ankle and won't stay too far away from me.

Now I have him locked in a room with its food, water and sand and he keeps meowing. Called the vet and he told me to keep the cat locked and checked from time to time until monday when he'll make a full check on the cat to see what's wrong.

The one I got an offer on is basically my backup plan. It'd be a fun position, but it's lower pay than what the other jobs would be, fairly significantly (10-15k, if not more). I delayed them as long as I could; I was told by one to expect an answer within 2 weeks, and 2 1/2 weeks later, I've heard nothing (contacting their HR recruiter after the 2 week mark just got me the answer that ""they're still deciding"").

The past weeks have been a blur of chaos for me. I've been extremely busy with work, being sent all over the place. I've had continuing issues with my supervisor.

Okay so I know this isn't like the most major thing, but I just feel good about listening to my gut and stuff, and doing a good thing. So we're both in our early 20s. Me and my older brother haven't had the best relationship for most of our lives, and though it has been getting better lately we still are kind of figuring out how to be open with each other and stuff, and he hasn't said anything about it. Not that I would really expect him to, as it really wasn't that big of a deal.

Anyways, I just feel good and want to tell someone without being all high-and-mighty and whatnot.

We were just on vacation, and we were swimming in the ocean. We had rented out a paddle board, but the winds were kind of strong so we only got one good run in a small bay, then decided to go to a different beach. This beach had bigger waves, and just as much wind. 

We get there and he just gets right in on the paddle board and was out there for just a minute or so before I decided to go swimming. After a few minutes I noticed that he wasn't up on the board anymore so I looked around and saw some flailing arms with a paddle and figured it was him. He steadied up though and began swimming back to shore. I had a thought that he might be struggling but I figured he would be fine.

After a minute or two I realize that he's still trying to get back to shore but hasn't made any real progress, so I decide to swim over and see if he needed any help. I get over there and ask if he needed help, but he was too winded to say anything. I asked if he was okay and he still didn't respond. So I just grabbed the board and swam him to the shore while he just hung on and dragged behind. He was tired out of his mind. 

He was totally fine, just tired. Although with the wind that day, who knows what would have happened otherwise. I didn't do anything that crazy, but I helped my brother out, and that feels pretty good.","This post is about a young man who was swimming with his brother on a paddle board vacation and helped him get back to shore after he was struggling with the waves.

Hey everyone!  I need some help.  Me and my girlfriend have two cats who have gotten a little food obsessed.  They were both kinda fat at one point so we, with the advice of our vet, put them on a diet of organic wet food (we use Prowl, the dehydrated stuff that you add water to).

Well, they're getting a little obnoxious now.  We used to keep their food on top of the fridge, but once they went on a diet they figured out how to climb up on top of the fridge, knocked the box over and ate like a half a box of dehydrated cat food.  So, we moved it to our laundry room, on top of the washer/dryer combo.  If we ever left the door cracked they were up there again, tearing into the box.  The final straw came this weekend when we had left the door closed but they got it anyway!  How you ask?  Well we live in a loft, and they actually climbed on top of the bathroom (there's like four feet between the bathroom ceiling and the loft ceiling) found their way in the laundry room through the roof of the closet and tore open the box of food.

I think partly they need something to do!  We both work a lot and I take care of my grandma on the weekends so they're home alone a lot.  I want one of those toys that you can put treats in and they have to play with it to get them out.

Basically, as the title says, I'll be studying in Madrid this coming July through a program with my (American) university.

Same girl as before, different problem. 

Started developing feelings for her and never really told her because I don't want it to affect our relationship. We're really close platonic friends and it's been that way since I've met her and I don't want that to change. Honestly just being her friend, listening to her talk, sitting next to her every day in class, gives me all the happiness in the world. I know she'll never see me as anything more than a friend and I've resigned myself to that fact. 

Not telling her that I like her though is killing me. I don't think she knows that I do like her, as nothing has changed between us at all.  It feels like I'm being dishonest about our relationship, but on the other hand I don't want her to be pushed away if I tell her. I'm her only close friend, up to the point that things that girls usually talk to amongst themselves, about boys, crushes, boy bands, whatever, are things that she talks to me about, despite the fact that I'm a straight heterosexual male. Argh. And now I'm rambling. Jesus. 

To make it even better, this entire situation is made even more complicated by a friend of mine, who was previously unacquainted with said girl, has now professed an interest in her and it's reciprocated.

I'm unsure if this would be the correct subreddit, as it didn't seem to fit in elsewhere, maybe askreddit or legal? If not, here goes.  

A little background, I'm in the military and looking to buy some car parts. I saw on the Perrin Performance website that they have a ""Military and first responder discount"" [reddit!] . To be approved for this, you need to email or call the representative listed with a few requirements and also list the parts you wish to purchase.  

After sending all of this I received an email this afternoon statin all of the (newly) priced items at about 10-15% discount (awesome!). The email also includes the following text, which I found incredibly off.

> If you'd like to complete an order, feel free to call or email me with your credit card number, expiration date, and 3 digit code OR send a paypal payment to sales@perrinperformance.com, just put it to my attention.  

I shot the representative an email back asking if he could somehow give me a discount code equalling the amount of the discount I was to receive noted in his email, as it didn't feel right to do either of the options listed. I am also going to call tomorrow to see if he could answer some other questions I may have. 

I can't wrap my head around it being a scam, as it is from a reputable company, it just seems odd that the initial payment options listed were what he mentioned.

Hello everyone,

just for some background: I am a computer engineering student from Brazil who absolutely hates what she does. I hate both my program and this stupid country (please don't take it personally fellow Brazilians) however I have only two semesters left to finish my program. I also recently came back from an exchange program in Canada that delayed my graduation in a year.

Now, getting this stuff off my chest: as said previously, I absolutely HATE the program! I hate it! I can't stand it anymore!! I just want to shoot myself whenever I am in class or doing some kind of homework. Why did I continue you ask? As stupid as it sounds, it is simply because my parents made me and because the program is free (here in Brazil there are certain kinds of university that are for free, but they are harder to get in). Basically if I left, I would've been forced to start working full-time and I didn't believe I would be able to get into University again for free again in those circumstances.

At this point I feel like it is too late to give up, and if I do so, I will be throwing many years of hard work in the trash. But on the other hand, I am just so miserable right now... As far as I am concerned, working delivering pizzas for the rest of my life sounds like a brilliant idea compared to what I am going through now.

Hi /r/personalfinance,

I own a condo that I bought in 2008, and initially lived in myself, but have been renting out ever since I moved away in 2010 for a better job. Between the rent, the property management fees, the mortgage payment, PMI, and HOA fees, I estimate that I am paying about $250-300 per month to own this property.

The tenants in the property for the past couple years are so pleased with it that they're working with a real estate agency (the same I used when buying it) to make me an offer on it. I still don't know the number that they will be offering, but my concern is how to really process that number. There seems to be so much at play:

* Tax breaks I've gotten and continue to get for paying a mortgage
* Property management fees I've paid over the past 5 years
* Property tax I've paid over the past 7 years
* All the mortgage interest that's been paid
* Taxes that would be assessed as part of the sale
* 3% agency fees that I'd have to pay for
* The rent that I didn't have to pay when I was living in the unit, that I would have had to if I hadn't bought it

Can anyone help me figure out how to really quantify the impact that selling it would have? I should also say that I'm in a financially strong position and that owning the property does not put me under any strain. I'd really like to be able to run the numbers and see what it looks like before making a decision one way or the other.

Hi guys,
I don't exactly frequent this subreddit but I'd really appreciate any advice you guys can give on where, how, when, why and what I should do with the money I've saved, as well as, what to do with future money I will save.

If you're curious for more information about my financial situation...

Basically, since I started working at 15 I have saved half of almost all of my paychecks. I started doing this so I could have some spending money but also be able to save for bigger purchases (like my car last year)

Since the beginning I have kept all saved money aside from my checking using a small safe only I know the passcode to.

I have a small amount saved still and plan to continue saving half of my income as long as my expenses are almost non-existent like they are now.

I have lived with various friends for the past 5 years and came to this subreddit since I didn't exactly have anyone to ask around me.

As for the half of my income that doesn't go to the safe, that is budgeted up to cover food, gas, and other expenses.","This person has a disciplined savings habit, consistently saving a significant portion of their income, and has been living frugally for a long time.

I'll start this off with the worst part that has proved to be the most damning - I have a Misdemeanor Theft II on my record in Oregon from 2009. 

To be honest, that instance completely changed my train of thought and goals. I was a pre-kinesiology major at the time and, after going through my conviction, transferred colleges and graduated with a Sociology degree focusing on Crime and Juvenile Delinquency. I graduated in 2011, and worked at a ""stepping-stone"" job until I was recently laid-off because of the lack of work. 

Well, TOMORROW I have a group interview with the State of Oregon's Department of Child Protective Services. I can tell you how qualified I am for this entry-level position but, to be honest, I can't stop thinking about how shitty it looks to have a Theft II Misdemeanor on my record. 

I've really turned my life around since 2009, have absolutely no drug history, and have chosen to go into a career field where I have the opportunity to make an impact on at-risk youth who may need to see that, even with a criminal record, you CAN be successful. 

I'd appreciate anyone with a related history or advice to chime in. I've never had a group interview before and have no idea what to expect.","This individual has a criminal record (Misdemeanor Theft II) from 2009 that has significantly impacted their career path and has taken them to pursue a career in child protective services, demonstrating a commitment to helping at-risk youth.

So for some back story I am moving in with a few friends of mine. One of them and his family previously lived in a home with 3 bedrooms and an office. My friend and I thought I would be great to get 2 of our co workers to move in to make the payments possible. Well I don't make too much money and my friend said I would only have to pay 600$ a month of the 2700$. Because I get the office. Which has no doors. No closet and is the smallest room. He agreed to pay extra cause he wanted to master bedroom. Now he is taking his word back and saying I have to pay 700. But I think it is unfair cause everyone else gets their own closet and door to their room which are actually down the hall away from the noise. My room is right next to the noise and front door too. I know 100$ doesn't seem like much. But it would really help me out on making the rent cause I am going to school and working this semester too. What is a polite of saying. If I don't get the 600. I will be moving back home the next month.","This post is a discussion about a roommate situation where one friend is demanding a higher monthly rent, and the author is expressing concerns about the unfairness of the situation, particularly the lack of privacy and noise issues.

**So, he's really, really hot.** And since I'm not the only one who thinks so, he has been with a lot of girls, and even a couple of guys. More than 100, he said. He doesn't quite know.
But! He gets tested (urine samples) regularly, the last time he checked out clean was three weeks ago. The bigger things, like HIV and Hep, he says he tests less frequently, but we live in one of the world's safest countries, there were only 122 new cases of HIV among sexually active men in 2012 (most recent statistics - gay or straight - yeah, I checked), and socialized medicine and strict rules makes it almost impossible not to be alerted within a relatively short timeframe after having had sex with someone who was positive.   
 
**I know this.**  
I also know how condoms work. However, I don't trust them. I think they'll break, or that something bad will happen somehow. I lube up, I (or he) puts them on the right way, we take every precaution - but I don't dare letting him finish. I have to tell him to quit, and then I finish him with a handjob or something. He says it's okay, but I hate being *that* girl, and I actually *want* him to fuck me long and hard, I just... I'm too scared.

specialist in Utah to correct this. Aleks was put into traction for about three days to help stretch out his spine so they had enough room to open the back of his head to fix everything. Surgery went better than expected. He was brought home a few weeks ago and seemed to be doing well, despite losing a lot of his motor skills due to the invasive surgery.

About two weeks ago he had an MRI to check on his progress. Sadly this showed that the surgery did not work as well as originally thought. Aleks needed to go back to Utah.

He arrived in Salt Lake City this past Sunday and had surgery number 2 on Monday. This one went well and was not as invasive as the first (they were able to clean things up working through his nose). Yesterday they did an X-Ray to follow up and again found they would need to go back in to clean up some more. As you could imagine, Aleks had a panic attack upon hearing this.

Our landlord is impossible and has made paying rent to him a hassle. He received checks the day before they were due, but because they took a couple days to clear to his account, he decided they were considered late and threatened us with fees. 

Because of this, my fiancé and I have decided to send cashiers checks to him via certified mail. (Cover our own butts and make a paper trail just in case.) However, previously, we had an automatic payment set up through online banking which would mail him a paper check. When we decided to do cashiers checks, I went to a branch personally and asked for a stop payment on all future checks to him and then went online and also stopped the automatic payment. 

The bank still mailed a paper check. And he cashed it. 

Our joint account (that we only have for bills and a tiny extra for savings) was completely drained, put in the red AND an nsf fee was charged.

Greetings people of r/jobs!
I have been recently looking for a job that's a step up from what I do. It would take a while to explain exactly what I do, but here's the short version: I make microchips.

I'm looking to relocate to Austin to help out a family member there and have seen a few positions that might fit me. But then there's the barrier of higher education. It kinda seems you need a four year degree and two associate degrees to become a waiter (exaggeration, but you get my point.).

In my current job, I learned how to operate machines I didn't even know existed prior to working there. I learned the ins and outs of how our product is made, all the steps and why. 

I even helped engineers modify one machine to fit our needs when previously it was collecting dust.

All this feels irrelevant because everyone says on their resume that they're a quick learner. In my case, it's not speculation. It's fact.

I've got reference's in spades. Engineers, Technicians, Managers, even a guy who reports directly to our CEO.

That being said, I feel like I won't be noticed or quickly filtered out due to my lack of a degree. (Despite, in some cases, looking at job duties and knowing I could do said job standing on my head while juggling sparklers and chainsaws. Exaggeration again. I can't juggle.)

Any advice beyond ""Get a degree"" would be helpful.

Regards, Mad Fake Scientist.","This individual is a skilled microchip maker with a proven track record of operating machinery and modifying equipment, demonstrating a deep understanding of the manufacturing process.

So last month at a party for my grandma's birthday, my grandma says there is this girl that she wants me to meet.  I'm apprehensive because my grandma is famous for setting my brother up on a date with a one armed girl. No offense to the one armed ladies out there, it just took my brother by surprise.  I also haven't dated much (read: at all), but I finally got a handle on some major depression and anxiety that has ruined my life for the past 10 years, so I agree to meet her.

So we go on a few dates, and awesomely enough she is not only cute as hell but fun to talk to and hang out with.  I have an awesome time, and as far as I can tell she has a great time too.  Couple of days after we last get together she asks if we can put off getting together again while she hunts for a job.  I say of course, because that seems pretty understandable to me.  

I text her a few times, asking how the hunt was going, or seeing if she had time to get dinner blah blah.  Didn't ever hear anything back.  5 weeks go by, don't hear anything.  O well, she is either still on the job hunt, or just not interested I suppose.  Then this morning I get back from the gym to see she accepted a facebook friend request I sent her a long time ago.

A little long, but this reddit is for ranting right? So here it goes.

My fiancee has a herniated disc in her back along with a pinched nerve. As you can imagine, it's extremely painful and has significantly impacted her quality of life. Things have gotten bad over the last few months. Back surgery is out because we can't afford it and insurance didn't cover it (the first fuck you). A back doctor recommended a procedure called a discectomy (it's kind of like surgery, but not as invasive).

After us and the back doctor talking to insurance we find out it's approved. Yes! However, they have one caveat that she can't get anesthesia (second fuck you) making the procedure painful, but hey a lot of pain for a short period of time is worth it if it helps her back (and she's been in crucial pain for months anyway).

This was all booked and ready to go back in January for this Thursday. We've been eagerly awaiting this day because it means she will be able to walk without being in pain. 

Then, the big fuck you happens. After getting approvals and confirmations MULTIPLE times from the insurance company. They called today and told my fiancee that they don't cover it after all. No reason why other than that ""we thought we did, but this isn't a procedure that we cover apparently"". This after we had a date booked for 2 months.  Now we don't know what to do.

It's kind of self explanatory but it's really very frustrating. 
I am going to Bangkok on the 9th and I'm trying to book a hotel. Now I'm not a total dweeb, I have booked loads of flights, hostels, hotels, buses and trains on a very tight budget before this. I feel like I'm alright with dodging the usual scams and tricks, clearing my cache and history to try to avoid trackers, using incognito mode in Chrome, but this time it is just not working. 

After narrowing down the thousands of options to four hotels/hostels. I picked my favourite, then looked on the booking sites all at the same time (via Quidco to save a few bob), they were all a similar price so I decided to book. 

The first one said this ""Due to a change in availability, this rate has increased since you made your selection"" so onto the next one, what a surprise, the same thing... or words to that effect, it has happened on each website I have been on. They all conveniently went up to the same price. 

I have tried it with eight different hotels on each booking website, and every one has done the same. How can they get away with doing this? As it's clearly not people booking in the time of me clicking on to the website and then onto book.

This girl has been hot and cold with me for as long as we've had classes together - sometimes she would invite me to spend time with her and her friends, and then completely stop talking to me, claiming that she's busy (which, as I've come to learn, 'busy' is 99% of the time a cover). She says a lot of nasty things about people, and then turns around and spends time with them. 

This past year was really hard for me due to personal issues, and while she and I were never that close, we became closer. She became supportive and would listen to me. I thought maybe she had grown, and I started to trust her.

That all changed when one of her male friends (that she has a thing for) told her he was interested in me - and he and I never met. She completely stopped talking to me, and the only reason I know this is because of a mutual friend.

I asked her in general if things were ok and how she was doing, and she said everything was good - so she wouldn't address this with me directly. I didn't want to directly say that I knew what her problem was, because I figured at this point, she should just be able to tell me what was up. 

Months later, out of the blue, she texts me and says that she's been really busy and not to take it personally that she hasn't been around. I said that I do take it personally, and then she responded back with how she doesn't have the energy to deal with me because she's so 'busy'. 

I'm SO done with her, and I've totally disconnected from her, as I find this response to be seriously rude and dishonest.

The issue is, we have a lot of mutual friends. How can I handle my disdain for her gracefully?","This person has been consistently unsupportive and manipulative, creating a difficult and emotionally draining situation.

I accidentally clicked through the dialogues and entered me wanting to use their Basic product instead of the free one.

I'm an Australian setting out in a few weeks to backpack around Asia, starting in Japan and then flying to Hong Kong. I was intending to apply for a Chinese visa in Hong Kong and spend some time there however I'm on a shoestring budget (which is fine, I stay in hostels and eat street food regardless).

I don't mind paying for the visa to get into China but I've noticed (because China is so massive) trains between many of the major cities cost ~$80 one way which is pretty steep for me.

I have been at my new job for 8 days - a small business with about 5 employees. In short I am taking over the jobs of two people who are leaving and were in drastically different roles (both have worked there for 10+ years) and have been given about 2-3 days of training in each role.

(X-post with [r/deaf] )

So this might be a long shot, but I'm looking for a little advice. I'm going to be taking a 2 month trip through Europe with my boyfriend. We are hostelling/airbnb-ing with our backpacks and doing europe on the cheap (as possible).

I am hard of hearing with one hearing aid (left) and one cochlear (right). I've traveled extensively with hearing aids before and it's pretty low maintenance. However, I've only had a cochlear for 3 years now and have yet to travel outside of the Us with one. I'm fairly able to communicate without sign language and my speech is quite good.

I am wondering the following:
-----------------------------------------------------

1. How should I keep my battery charged: bring my charger / disposable individual batteries / both? It generally takes 1-1/2 hours to charge a battery with the charger. They last for 2.5 days. Batteries where you replace individually them are 2 at a time and disposable and last as long but generally are more expensive than using the rechargeable

2. Do you suggest I bring up my back up cochlear or leave it at home. I'm thinking at home, but bringing some basic things like hooks because they are cheap

3. Are people in Europe generally open and friendly towards disabled persons / hard of hearing members? 

4. Is it easy to pick up 675 zinc air blue tab batteries in stores in Europe? I ask because I wonder how easy it'll be to get more if they are stolen / lost / etc

5. Anything else I should consider while travelling with a cochlear implant?

Also in case it helps, my itinerary: The Netherlands > Belgium > West Germany > France > Switzerland > Austria/Hungary > Czech > Poland > Germany > Denmark 
We are spending at least 3 days in each place.","This traveler is planning a 2-month trip through Europe with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant, aiming for a low-cost experience.

I suppose everyone will wonder how I'm able to view these texts. I'm not spying on him, (well, in a sense I'm not). My father and I have iPhones, and he logged into iMessage on my phone, and I guess that if he uses iMessage on his phone, if I'm logged into his account on my phone, I get all of his conversations. 

Now to the juicy part, for a lack of better terms. Over the past few days, I have read conversations of his to random number such as, and I quote, ""Wife is out of town. Wanna meet up? Name a price per hour."" and also - ""Want to meet up? Missing you :( "". 

What scares me most about this is how sincere he sounds in the texts. Almost as if they have a semi-strong relationship, or as if they're somewhat dependent on each other. Fucking emoticons? My parents have been married for around 20 years, and I won't sit here and say that there hasn't been any sleeping around/cheating on my fathers side of the marriage. I don't have a close enough relationship with my parents where I feel I could talk to either of them about this. 

I also don't believe that I have a right to be reading theses conversations, whether he's my father or not. I was considering just logging out, and deleting all the conversations, but I'm not sure. My parents and I don't have the most personal relationships, and my childhood has always consisted of a one way relationship with them. They express their opinions to me, show me love, treat we decent(ish), and I listen, say yes sir and yes mam and move on. 

I have no idea what to do, and if anyone wants to know, there are about 10 conversations going on throughout the week.","This post expresses a concern about a father's potentially secretive communication with his son, leading to the reading of their iMessage conversations.

Starting a new job on wednesday paying AUD $24.11 p/h + 9.5% super, 8 hrs a day with 30 minute lunch break 5 days a week. Its a call centre job, not cold calling.  We answer queries from customers about their utility bills etc. The contract for this job is for 6 months (probationary).

I also have family friends in company so lets just say that i will have my contract extended for the purpose of my query. Im also looking to do a networking/system administration certification in the upcoming months (which will cost around $2k, give or take).

So presuming the credit card fee stays the same, what would be better to pay off first?

I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?","This individual is experiencing a significant decline in running performance, struggling to maintain consistent mileage and a reasonable pace.

I will try to keep this short. 

June, 2013 I noticed a big drop in my Credit Score. I had a collection from a hospital (They had a super old address on record and sent all bills there, I never received them. Eventually the unpaid bill went to Collections.) Since it was sent to collection I was no longer able to work with the hospital on paying it off. Medicredit was the collection agency, they allowed me to pay off half of it. I had to pull some money together, I called back and made the payment over the phone. 

7 months later I am pulling a credit report for a Home Mortgage I am applying for, It shows up as still unpaid. I contact the Medicredit, they say I never pay. I provide proof from my bank statement, the contact info was linked to their headquarters. I am told to email someone and they will look at it from the finance department. I do that and send a copy of the transaction info. I keep an eye out on my credit info, and it is removed in June. Fast forward to September, and it showed up again.

I began talking to a guy online maybe 2 or 3 months ago and it's progressed very fast. I am only 18 and he's 25, although I have moved out of home and support myself. We talk all day, every day, calling or facetiming pretty much every night. He really, really likes me but the problem is I don't like him as much. It was all fine, until recently I mentioned how it sucks I'll never see him. Fast-forward a couple of days and he tells me he has found a super cheap plane ticket to the city I live in. He asks if I would be open to him coming to visit and not really thinking or wanting to hurt his feelings I said of course! He bought it right then and there and now I am scared. As time goes on my attraction to him is fading and I can see that he mainly likes me because I am his ideal 'perfect girl'. He is not my perfect guy, I do not want to commit to him and I am not sure if I even have feelings for him.

It's all very nice that people can make changes in their lives to make it go away, but for many or most, that does not help at all. If you have been feeling depressed for a time longer than six months, and/or it interferes with your life, see a counselor AND GP. Sure, many have factors in their lives which cause them to feel this way, but many are genetically predisposed to the condition and no scenery change or 'opening up' will change that.

Go to a counselor (not a psychiatrist) to determine whether your problems are psychological, and a GP to determine whether it is at all related to any physical issues that you may have (allergies, diet, et cetera). Go to a specialist at the recommendation of your counselor and GP. Starting with a specialist can be problematic, first because it may cost you unnecessarily, and second because, at least in my experience, someone who limits their field of work can sometimes limit their field of vision. Unnecessary treatment and incorrect diagnosis kind of suck. So, start out with a wide view, and work your way toward a more focused treatment.

Hey guys and gals I'm planning a trip and wanted to hear some suggestions and input from you all. I will describe myself and what I am looking for based on my research as well as I can.

Myself:

I am a 23 y/o white male living in Atlanta and from Florida originally. My previous trips out of the country have all been to either Europe or the Caribbean and while I enjoyed them I am looking for something different this time. I really like the outdoors, wildlife, and thrill seeking. I used to swim and love all forms of water, but also enjoy a good mountain or rain forest. I took a couple years of spanish and could get to a passable level if necessary. I have a lot of vacation days to use before the end of the year and right now am planning on taking two weeks off for this trip.

What I am looking for:

The above section applies to this one as well but I will try to go more in depth here. The best way I have found to describe what I'm looking for is an adventure. I haven't done well in pinning specific activities to how I want this trip to make me feel, which is why I'm asking you wonderful people, but I want to feel any or all of these: awestruck, humbled, risky, unconstrained, unfamiliar. I would like to go some place where I can see/experience a good variety of things and places during my trip, which means I wouldn't stay in one place for more than a couple days. I would prefer to avoid extra flights once there, but if it would open up a lot of opportunities I would consider one halfway through. I think that optimally I would rent a motorcycle or something (and drive a few hours every couple days)as this would fulfill several of my interests(variety of places, unconstrained, (slightly) risky, adventure).

For valentine's I plan on making a homemade meal for my girlfriend(18) yet the problem is that she has a very fine selection of what she eats. In the time we have been together, almost two years, she has only ever eaten chicken(fried and boneless, pretty much chicken tenders), peanut butter, french fries(not the steak fries) plain bread and cheese and plain butter noodles. She also hates sauces aling with beef and pork, though I don't think shes ever had either. Any type of sauce she will not eat as well. 

-side note- she did try pesto sauce once and didn't hate it. Victory!

Usually when we go out she'll order off the kids menu because she knows the adult portions have things added that she would not like. 

I on the other, I hand love savory food. I love sauces and spice and some heat in my food. I love seafood and meats. Cheeses and good espresso. I am under 21 so no wine yet. Yet I am also a southerner so fried chicken, cornbread, sweet tea and collards run through my veins.

Hi all, not sure if I selected the right tag or not but I wanted to get your opinions and advice on a predicament I have.

Next year my wife and child are going to move out as we are going to get divorced. As horrible as this will be, I need to focus on the future and for myself to be happy.

One thing I have always wanted to do and couldn't when my wife was here was to get a dog. I grew up with dogs and love them.  I have really wanted a dog for years but my wife didn't want them. 

Anyway, as I would be divorced, it would mean I would be living on my own (in an apartment). I am concerned that it wouldn't really be fair on the dog to work a full time job and only spend time with it in the evenings and have it stay at home all day on its on.

What are your thoughts and opinions on this sort of case? Particularly dog owners who live on their own - what do you do? 

Another important matter is that I live in this country on my own, so I couldn't have family come over and see it etc (they are all back in England, whilst I'm in the USA).

Anyway, sorry for the long post, but I wanted to see what you all thought on this? What advice you may have or if you can think of any tips?

Last month (July 19th to be exact) I went for a 6 mile run and totally blew my knee. I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old ""normal"" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace!

I need help/advice. I'm 22 now, so most of my friends are in different states for college. I am anxious most of the time, crave alone time when I'm out with a friend, and can be very introverted.

So fresh out of college, Northwestern Mutual talked us into a 80-year term life insurance plans for 300k each (wife and I). Premiums were around $70 monthly combined. We since rolled 75k of each into permanent life insurance. Now premiums are in excess of 200 monthly.

So I'm setting up a meeting to cancel all these and get them into a 30-year term plan with them, largely due to recommendations on this sub. That should free up a lot more budget for me. And I plan to take care of a couple debts with the difference, and eventually start rolling the difference into a RothIRA.

I plan on keeping the 30-year insurance through them. But when I get into a Roth IRA, I'll do that through vangaard or something lower fees. NWM is notorious for getting 5% year on year, and I've seen many other options that yield better interest.

Hopefully, in 30 years (I'm 27), I'll be pretty financially set, and I'll either take another term life insurance at a higher rate, or ideally have enough of a retirement account not to have to worry about it.

My financial advisor there, I'm sure, will be adamant that I'm making a mistake. He already alluded to that in an email. I just want to make sure I'm armed with the right info and am confident in my decision going into it, and I""m pretty new with all this.

I have two cockatiels, one of which is very old, pushing 18 years of age. She is very fragile and very care intensive. She is unable to sleep on a perch anymore, so she usually sleeps in a soft pillow-lined box draped in towels with a number of soft socks and scarves to cuddle up in. I have a cage for her to stay in, but I feel like I'm punishing her if I lock her up in it. 

I'm leaving for a graduation trip to another city for the New Years (about an 8 day stay) and I do not really want to take the birds on a 12 hour drive across country. Unfortunately, the only people I trust to proved proper care for the birds (especially my elderly bird) are my parents who are also going on the trip with me.

I know that keeping track of your expenses is a no brainer...  everyone knows they should be doing that.  But, I wanted to offer a warning to people who are relying on the balance reported by their bank, particularly financial responsibility noobs who have tight budgets.

I have been banking online almost exclusively for several years.  When I first started out, I thought it would be the most convenient, hassle-free, error-free way to keep track of spending... after all, it's all right there for me to see, anytime I'm online.  But, I noticed quickly that my mental balance was different than the balance shown on my account.  Why?  Because purchases don't necessarily happen in real time with real amounts.  Various merchants will sometimes authorize a smaller amount before actually charging the full amount.  Consider the case where I spend $60 to fill my car with gas.  Three days later, the $60 has still not left my account.  There is, however, a $1 authorization charge, which will change later.  If I just go by the balance reported by my bank, I will think that I have more money than I actually have.  This happens also anytime you leave a tip.  **Note that it almost never goes the opposite direction.  You will almost never have more money in your account than is being reported by your bank.  This is a systematic error.**

For me, at any given time, I would say that my reported balance is about $100 *more* than the money I actually have.  If you're running a tight ship like I am, that's a large margin of error.","This post is a cautionary tale about the potential for errors in online banking and the misleading nature of bank balance reports.

Hey /r/Running,
I'm a 15 year old high school sophomore. I just found out I had a stress fracture (left foot, second metatarsal) a little while ago, and am forced to take time off. Hopefully I can start running again in late March/early April, and get in one race (probably not varsity though, as the season ends in late April, early May if our school goes to CIF). 

Anyway, when I start running again I don't want to be completely out of shape, especially since I already spent three long months developing cardio. Any advice for that I can to to insure that my cardio (and muscle development) doesn't go away completely? The cardio is especially important, since I primarily do the 1600 and 3200.

My local gym had a hand bike, but my family isn't doing so well financially, so I'm trying to not have to join. Right now I've flipped the bikes in my garage upside down and am using them as a hand bike, but they don't work my cardio like running or even a real hand bike. I can't bike since I have the boot on, and I'm going to the doctor Tuesday to see if I can do pool workouts (even if I can, I don't have a pool so I would have to get permission to use a friend's pool, and that could only happen probably 3 times a week or so).

In addition to any ideas for cardio, what weight training should I do? Ad I mentioned above, I do distance in track and cross country in the fall. Our team doesn't do weight training, but everyone says its important. Plus I need to strengthen myself to make sure I don't get injured again when I come back. I was out my freshman year in cross country because of tendinitis and osgood-slatter (spelling?) in my right knee, so I seem to be more prone to injuries that my teammates.

Hi Reddit,

I'd like to make painting and drawing one of my hobbies, but I almost always feel frustrated enough to quit after spending X amount of time on a project. I spend a lot of time working on details, and as soon as I realize it's not coming out as well as I imagined it I start getting annoyed.

I should really say run/walk, I am no where near advanced enough to simply ""run"".

I'll try to stick to the ""need to knows"" and keep this short-ish...

I trained last fall for a half marathon, I ended up not run/walking in the official marathon(financial issues) so instead went to a park where I normally do my thing, I ran/walked the 13.1 miles on my own(my time was 3:11:17). That was in October. November I barely ran (maybe 10 days total, including a 10k, but most of the other runs were 1.5-3 miles).

My best friend has been looking to get a dog for sometime now. She has always had huskies, and was ready to get another, as her last dog had passed away a year ago. 

After careful talking and collaboration with her, we decided that as a ""Christmas gift"" I would pay for her puppy. I am normally against the puppy for Christmas thing, but she wanted a puppy, the time of year just worked out like that. 

I have 3 dogs myself, all rescues, I wasn't overly familiar with the process of buying a dog. But I know enough to know that I did in fact end up supporting a puppy mill. 

This pup is a husky, he cost me $350, which is insanely cheap for a husky puppy (Sign #1). The ""breeder"" wouldn't let me on the property to see the dogs (Sign #2). The breeder also had no organization, no contracts, no vet records, no health certificate, nothing. I know I shouldn't have gotten the dog from him. I supported a puppy mill. This poor pup is stained with pee and feces. 

So why did I do it? I was so caught up in getting my friend a husky, which again she knew about, that I looked past my better judgement. 

Not to mention, upon meeting this guy to pick up the puppy, I was alone. I had gone to meet him before with my boyfriend and he said he was fine because we were meeting in a public place and he didn't seem weird last time. This time I went alone, he didn't speak much and kept staring at me. After I paid for the dog and took him he told me to give him a hug, being scared I did.

My boyfriend's parents live about an hour and a half away. We visit them regularly (used to be every other weekend pre-dog). Since adopting Cocoa, we have visited them 3 times (we have had her two months). She comes along. She is great in the car!

They have a dog, a 3 year old collie/border collie cross. She's a bit neurotic and under socialized. And morbidly obese. She's nice enough I guess, and they're trying to bring down her weight, but they only recently started walking her regularly. I suspect she's pretty under exercised but she's also a pretty lazy dog (maybe because of her weight..) 

So the weird bit. When Cocoa is allowed to approach Roxy after they greet/play and Roxy is panting, she immediately goes for Roxy's tongue and mouth and tries licking/nibbling. She does this so much that Roxy gets agitated and the bickering starts. 

Note that we have been pretty slow on the introductions in that we keep them separated most of the visit, let them romp outside to tucker them out off leash (they play hard, but lots of bows and positive body language, so they seem to get along), and have walked them together. They have gotten more used to each other with every visit. They just can't seem to settle when off leash around each other. They have to be physically separated or Roxy will approach Cocoa and Cocoa will keep trying to lick her. I am concerned the nibbling and subsequent romping will lead to aggression; it hasn't so far, but we separate them until they settle again. 

I just can't understand why Cocoa wants to lick/nibble Roxy's tongue. She doesn't do this to dogs at the dog park. She's pretty independent and happy to leave other dogs alone. Except Roxy. She kind of fixates and the two just can't rest without us physically intervening.

I went from not working or doing anything during the day for the past two years... to being a nanny for 7 weeks from 6am-5pm and then working at a local retail store.... to then finding a full time job that is PERFECT for me.  

I'm having a really hard time adjusting to the schedule and simply put... I just don't want to do anything when I get home from work. 

Its also summer on Long Island and its like a sauna 90% of the days.  The air is thick and humid. 

I don't know if part of my issue is also that I'm not eating correctly and taking my supplements lately.  I'm a gastric bypass patient.  Almost 15 months post op.  Down 188lbs.  I feel like my body is done losing and I think that is also part of my problem. 

I feel like I need an ass kicking or a reboot.  

I need my mojo back.  I need to get back on the pavement.  I miss it.  My body misses it.  My back has been killing me and I know its because I'm not releasing the tension.

So, here's some backstory...

My boyfriend and I just moved in together less than a month ago and one of our first priorities was to adopt a kitten from his dad. We hand raised this kitten from birth and she is the sweetest, most precious girl ever.

Well, this morning at about 1am, I sat in our recliner. Now, I always check underneath before I sit down because she likes to nap under there. I didn't see her, but when I sat down and lifted the foot rest, I heard a horrible scream and she ran out from underneath. She had been INside the recliner and I didn't know. After getting her to come to me and stop crying, I got a better look and the bone was protruding from her tail (about an inch away from the base) and she was bleeding all over me. Naturally, my boyfriend is out of the country for two weeks and I cannot get in touch with him (or anyone) at 1am.

After much hysteria, I finally got in touch with my SO's father and we got my little Kiwi to the emergency vet and only left at about 6am. The vet informed us that the only thing to do was to amputate her tail so she's only going to have a little stump. The main problem? This bill is $2500 and my boyfriend and I are backed up on bills from the move. We have the money to pay it, and luckily his father paid it for us and we can just pay him back over time, but still...","This post is about a cat named Kiwi who was adopted from a boyfriend's dad and had a traumatic experience inside a recliner.

Short story time. 

I made a goof recently with paying my credit card bill. I always pay in full the week prior to it being due. I don't do auto pay for this card because often times I have things being refunded back to it or credited to it and would rather calculate how much I need to pay to hit $0 balance myself. Whereas with auto pay it would likely overpay and I would have account credits. Not a big deal, but something that bothers me.

Anyways. I was going out for the weekend. So I quickly jumped on, figured out what I needed and hit pay, got up and ran out the door without even looking back. Didn't check my email for confirmation and overall just screwed up.

Today I got an email from my creditor (Chase) saying that I was late in paying and was hit with a $25 Late fee. Obviously I was distraught. 

I immediately got in contact with them and asked if there was an off chance that since I have never been late before and use this card a lot if they could waive the late fee and interest charges I would likely incur. Without hesitation they said ""No Problem"". They credited me the late fee and are waiving interest for 2 months. 

Needless to say, I was relieved. Even though it wasn't a lot of money, it was stressful. I haven't paid interest in nearly a year and dread the thought of ever doing so again.","This person made a mistake in paying their credit card bill, resulting in a late fee and interest charges.

My mom adopted him in late 2009. He was sent back from the shelter TWICE, despite the fact that the shelter strongly warned the adopting families that Bart was a mature, independent cat who didn't do well with children and needed to be the only pet. Apparently, when he was returned, it was because he was ""mean.""

Hi all,

I'll try to keep this short. 

In 2014, TimeWarner tried to charge me $90 (which I genuinely owed them) but was incredibly stupid about how they went about trying to get it from me. I was a continuing customer, paying a monthly bill, but they never bothered to call or email me about the charge, which they ended up sending to a collection agency. After being contacted by the agency, I corrected the issue with TimeWarner. Seemingly issue resolved...

Then, in the summer of 2015, I get more collections calls about the same debt. I investigate with TimeWarner, and apparently it was just an error in their system sending out the same debt. Caught it early, so no damage. 

Then today, I discover on CreditKarma that my score was hit (~800 -> ~750) and I had no idea why. Turns out that TW sent that was $90 debt to another agency in February, but that agency never bothered to contact me, so it actually ended up hitting my TransUnion report. Both TW and the agency were WAY less than helpful on the phone today, and I'll have to spend some more time with them tomorrow... but it will be resolved, at least in terms of me not having to pay. 

BUT, the real issue is that I'm about to go to Law School this fall, and I'm looking down the pipe of about $50k in private student loans that I need to apply for this summer (to cover the first year). I've still got decent credit, my parents will cosign, and I'm going to a great school with almost sure prospects of landing a BigLaw gig in NY, but still I'm worried that TW's incompetency is going to cost me $$$ down the road in higher interest rates.","This person experienced a frustrating situation with a debt collection, where they were initially charged with a $90 debt, but the issue was resolved with TimeWarner, only to have their score negatively impacted by a subsequent agency collection.

This may be obvious to some, but it has helped me get a much better picture of my finances. For years I struggled with paying bills, sometimes because of low income but just as often because I was disorganized. After making simple changes to my bank account structures I don't miss bills, have lowered my spending and can understand my expenses better.

The trick is pretty simple. Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses. Then go about setting them all on auto-pay. Most of the time you can connect the bank numbers or use a debit card to automate payment. If you need to pay an individual or have to pay by check most banks have a bill pay feature that will send scheduled payments by check.

At first you'll need to overpay into this account because your expenses estimate might be off and you need a buffered balance. After a couple of months you'll be able to pay in almost exactly what you need. Then you can setup automatic deposit to cover all your expenses.

Congratulations, your financial life is now completely automated. Did you remember to pay such and such bill? Yeah totally. Analyzing your accounts it looks like you're paying for a lot of online storage. Google sells space cheap. Consolidate accounts and save. Get hit with an unexpected bill? There's plenty of buffer in the account, just pay a bit more in to make up and move on.

It can take a while to move all your accounts over, but once you do the benefits of organization are massive. Also, once you make that one or two payments into the account per month (pay into it right when you get income) whatever remains is your spending / saving money.","This post is a guide to automating financial tasks through a dedicated checking account.

This all started out quite a while ago. I think it was somewhere in early highschool. You know the typical discussion between guys talking about their girlfriends. Not wanting to feel left out you claim you have a girlfriend. Combine this with never really getting asked along to any party and not really know any girls that never really changed. I guess the source of that was my lack of self confidence due to getting bullied in elementary school.

But now quite a few years later I'm still building up on those stories. I'm in college now and keeping up with the tradition for engineering students I still don't have a girlfriend and I still come up with excuses to avoid social events (though I've been forcing myself to attend some things). I still tell lies all the time to claim I have a social life though I obviously don't. This is further complicated by running into a girl last year that I actually did like and somehow managed to start talking to. Tried asking her out several times and she always said no and came up with an excuse (even though she was becoming more and more friendly). Eventually I got pissed at that and told her to fuck off as she was clearly not interested in me and was probably only doing it to get help. Weirdly enough I managed to never tell a single lie to her. I still like her at this point but I know it's pointless yet I find myself unconsciously fixing my schedule in such a way that I run into her. To the few friend-ish people I have at college I claim it's cause it annoys her but really it's simply cause I still like her and have fake hope. The thing is, thanks to her I did notice I need to stop this entire cycle of telling lies and really become more social. I just don't really know where to start and how. Making all those lies come true seems rather hard or pretty much impossible so I doubt that's the way to go about it.

Hi, hoping this is the right sub for my question, apologies if not.

I was browsing my account on Credit Karma recently and saw the message that ""1 account has gone into collections"". I thought this couldn't be right, so I looked and it said I had a $277 balance in collections by an agency called ""Enhanced Recovery Company"". Around the same time my mom let me know that the company had been leaving messages for me on her home phone. 

I didn't see any way that this could be a legit debt, as my only debts are my car loan and one credit card. Also, I don't know how they got my mom's phone number, as I haven't used that number as my own in well over a decade. Every lease and agreement I've signed has been using my personal cell phone number.

I'm 22 years old, and have managed to drop my credit score to below 600. This started with a Best Buy Credit card that my 19 year old self ""knew"" I would be ok obtaining.

My former high school (I have moved away and graduated from college and started m life in another state) recently made the news on my Facebook feed for banning The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. The school board, earlier this year, approved he purchase of a classroom set, and it was on the syllabus since before school even started. The instructor gave a trigger warning and offered an alternate book (for those unaware, this book deals with incest/rape/racism). The students started the book, then a couple days in, the principal interrupted the class, snatched all the books from the students.

Hello, /r/personalfinance. I need some advice as I'm TERRIBLE with my finances. 

I'm 19 years old and attending college. I live with my parents but am looking to move out in the next month.

I make ~$1000 a month (at $10/hour).

Currently the only bills I have are my cell phone and car insurance ($80/$100 respecticely). Well just recently I wrecked my Jeep into a tree so I have to buy a ""new"" one. I currently have $1600 and been browsing Craigslist waiting for a good deal. 

Now the apartment my friend and I are looking at it $500/month plus utilities (~$200/month according to a friend already living in the complex). My college is paid for by financial aid so I don't have to worry about that. So split two ways roughly $350 a month. Plus my bills brings total expenses up to $550 a month leaving me around $450. Now this has to go to gas, food, and other expenses.

How can I make the rest of my money go it's furthest? What initial expenses am I overlooking when moving into an apartment? Any advice on saving and making my money last would be greatly appreciated.","This young adult is struggling with a significant financial situation, having a low income, a car accident, and a new apartment.

I was in South Korea for two months this summer, studying abroad. I chose to go there partly because my older sister happens to live in South Korea as an elementary school English teacher and I wanted to visit her. Saved up for a year to scrape up enough money to pay for half of it (scholarships covered the other half).

I stayed with my sister for about one month of it. I understood that we'd both changed during the long time we didn't see each other so I shrugged off various things that would have bothered me otherwise, and we had a great time hanging out together and catching up and having fun. Anyway fast-forward to today when I've been back in the states for a month and she just messaged me saying that she got into a toxic relationship a few days after I left, cropped up with a host of health problems, and just found out that she has a stress-induced hernia (whatever that may be), and part of the reason is that she couldn't handle me leaving. 

As soon as she told me all this, she tried to blow it off and make light of it, especially about the relationship she's in (what details she did tell made me really uneasy). On top of that she decided to re-sign her teaching contract and stay for at least another year. I know I'm responsible for part of this situation (especially since I gave her the idea to teach in South Korea in the first place) and I could have done more to help her out but at the time I had no idea that she had counted so much on my being around. She's four years older than me and we didn't even become friends until recently. I always looked up to her because she was always taller/more beautiful/more mature than me and I was so busy being excited that she was treating me like an equal to see that she was having a lot of other problems.

I keep catching myself planning to go back to Korea as soon as I can just to try to help her out. But I can't go, because I'm in the thick of my senior year in university, I have no money anymore for travel, and I can hardly think straight myself because of school expectations.","This post expresses a complicated situation where the author is grappling with guilt and regret over their past actions, and they are considering a return to South Korea to help their sister, but are facing significant obstacles and uncertainty.

Hello personal finance saviors 

My story is:

Me and my fiancée decided to move to the United States[Kansas] (she's a US citizen while I am from Egypt) the system of finance in my country is totally different I have been always relying on debit cards and saving account hence spending only what I have and managing to save as much as I can. 

The situation is that I managed to save around 5k USD (not that much but that's around 50k of my national currency). 
My fiancée in contrary is spending a lot on lots of unnecessary stuff for example buys new clothes every month or so and she is in big debt (university loans and whatnot) but since we are marrying soon after I come to the US (next month) I am totally in the dark side of the financial stuff like what do I do with my savings? Just open a normal savings account? Which bank do I use[Kansas state]? and what are the investment opportunities? Is joint account going to be risky for me giving the inputs above ?

I am just curious about one thing and that is the best way to go about financing my purchase, more specifically getting the loan. For anyone who is curious, the reason I want to buy new is because I plan to start a family in the near future and want something that falls into place with that and can get my fiance and I to work daily.

If my fiance and I both have limited credit histories (almost 2 years for me, 1 year for her) and scores in the very high 600s, low to mid 700s, would it make sense for her to cosign on a loan with me or should I ask a family member with a more extensive credit history? We have already looked over our finances extensively and decided upon what we can afford together since we are getting married this year, but I just want to know what makes sense in regards to applying for our auto loan. I am looking to get the best interest rate and more than likely looking into a 72 month loan (lower payments but I will pay it off before the term is up).

The dealer I am looking into has a financing program that gives a 500$ discount to recent grads (Honda), but should I look to get my loan from a bank I have a history with (Wells Fargo) or even joining a local Credit Union since they give the lowest rates? 

Also, if it helps, I am going to be making about a 20% downpayment depending on how much I can afford later this year (already have a good portion saved in a separate account) and I am aiming for an OTD price of $30,000 - $32,000 when I begin negotiations.

I'm contemplating applying for [this card] I'm trying to get my credit back on track after moving overseas (from the U.S.) and neglecting my finances back home for years. I already have a Capital One card that's unsecured and has a $2,500 limit. I'm charging Netflix to it to keep a balance ticking over, then have the bill paid automatically every month from checking.

This has been in operation for something like nine months. About three months ago, I decided to apply for another card I thought I'd qualify for, hoping to increase my overall limit. I was denied. Got an offer in the mail for another one just recently, applied for it and was rejected. Little do these banks know, I have many years of perfect payment history overseas.

Anyhow, I have a fairly huge emergency fund and no debt. I think putting a $3,000 deposit down and getting this secured card may be a good move in my quest to improve my credit standing. As I understand it, the higher limit would reduce my utilization somewhat, but would also show that banks were willing to lend to me (even though they're actually not). One of the reasons cited for rejections has been a low number of open accounts.

Is this smart? The deposit for this card would be placed in an interest-bearing account, according to the terms. There's a chance – it's not clear how big a chance – that I'd be converted to an unsecured account after a year or so. I hope at that point I'd be able to withdraw my money, although astonishingly the T&C don't address this at all. The only downside I can think of is a situation where I'm not able to convert it to an unsecured card in the future but I want/need the deposit. I'm also not clear on whether converting to unsecured would mean opening a new account and closing the original, which it seems would negatively affect average account age.","This individual is considering applying for a secured card to improve their credit, hoping to increase their limit and demonstrate a willingness to lend.

I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.

I'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents.

Should I have corrected him? If so, how should I have responded?

I'm asking reddit because there are a lot of people who have (strong) opinions on grammar nazis and when to behave like one. 

My opinion is that so long as the main message is conveyed well enough, I don't say a word. (For example, everyone knows what a grammar nazi is. Should I have taken the time to find out whether ""grammer"" and/or ""nazi"" should be capitalized? I don't think so.) But I also wouldn't mind if someone corrected me.

So, in the case with my convo with my coworker, I didn't say anything because I knew what he meant. But I also thought, ""What if he uses that phrase incorrectly again?

This has been happening to me a lot lately. I'll get an interview, and the person who has seen my resume tells me right off it looks like my experience is a great match for the position, before we even start.

Hi everyone. I'm utterly lost and scared shitless.

To start off:

When I was 18, I left an abusive home to go to college in another state. I was told that I could get financial aid if I could submit my fafsa - but after multiple attempts I couldn't get it to go through because my father was blocking me in one way or another. I wasn't aware at the time that I could apply as an independent. In short, I accrued $18,000 in debt from that college which went into collection.

I then returned to my hometown and I've since been attending another institution and received federal student aid - but I took dual-credit classes in high school which didn't contribute to my degree, but ended up counting against my federal credit hours cap so I was denied further federal aid and my appeal wasn't accepted.

Now I'm in my last stretch of my career. I'm in 2 classes right now and I will take 2 classes over the summer and then I'll be able to graduate. But I need to get a loan to pay for this semester and the next and I can't seem to get approved because of the default. 

My plan thus far was to finish college and then start paying off that 18k. There's no way I could pay that loan right now and still afford my living expenses.

It's been 5 years since the date of the default and I don't know if I should somehow get a loan and let that default reach its 7 year limit (because I don't think it counts as a student loan...) or if I should try to go through a debt repayment agency to get that 18k out of default.","This individual has a significant amount of debt accumulated from a traumatic experience, including a college loan and a series of failed attempts to secure federal aid.

Hey so I started this job two years ago. I am thinking of going elsewhere. I just wanted to confirm with you guys that I'm making a good choice.

When I started there, there was a co worker who started 4 months before who would berate me and yell at me and my foreman would go around telling everyone that this co worker was the best and best worker they have ever seen.
I went and told my boss about the verbal abuse and harassment after a month this co worker quit.

For the next 8 months this foreman than would glare at me and tell me to work harder and tell me I wasn't a good worker, among other things.
I did tell him to treat me fairly and that hey this isn't right.

So things settled for a while. Now for the last three months. He doesn't even talk to me at all anymore. He will talk through our work lead to talk to me.
I have tried talking to him but all i get is one word answers

I have been looking for a new job and might have a new one in two months.

Just 2 weeks ago, my family and I went to a shelter for rescued pets and got a 1 year old cockapoo. Ever since he got home, we (mostly me) have been training him everyday. Since he just got neutered when he got home, he felt very insecure and would bark at anybody who would come in the house, room, etc. That was the time when my parents, siblings and I had a talk about the dog. My parents didn't want him because they thought he was a threat to our family and might bite one of us eventually. That was the first reason why they wanted to give him back to the shelter UNTIL, my dad became attached to him and gave him a second chance (which didn't last very long btw). So then, my dad gave him a week, and he stopped barking at us. after that week, we decided to keep him but just today my mom called everyone again and had a talk about the dog. My mom and dad want him back in the shelter again since he kept peeing, pooping and making messes inside the house. My mom was very stressed and I said it was okay to give him back.

I recently shopped around and went to a dealership to see what kind of financing I could get for a vehicle on their lot that I really liked and thought I could get a good deal out of. I requested a $10,000 loan.

The way my credit was at the time, I had 100% on time payments with a 12 month credit history of payments, I also had a new line from Best Buy credit that has been going two months now. Prior to this loan request, I had a 678 score. 

Shortly after talking with the dealer and running my credit, I decide that I'm not financially set enough to be buying a car. To add insult to injury, I find out over the next couple weeks that they contacted 18 various banks and credit unions for financing...all denying my loan. I would read each letter stating the reasons for denial and seeing my score drop... 658...647...630...625...and now finally 615 where I'm at the end of the inquiries. During this time, I managed to miss ONE payment from Best Buy which resulted in a single interest charge and double payment that I caught up on the next month. I am current on the payment of that now.

I wasn't too sure of where to actually post this, but I was hoping maybe someone could give me a bit of advice. Here's a bit of the back story. My aunt got married to my uncle who is 12 years older than her, who never wanted children or to be married in the first place. My aunt has always had issues with herself, forced the marriage and kids upon him therefore making for a bad relationship between my aunt and uncle.
Fast forward to today, my aunt has a 13 year old lets call her Mary and 19 year old lets call her Jill. Jill was babied growing up until Mary came a long then she had to grow up fast. Growing up Mary has always been babied and never encouraged to do anything for herself. She was never encouraged to say please or thank you, never encouraged to talk to people, never even encouraged to go to school. Mary is 5'7 and weighs probably 230+lbs. For a 13 year old who is going through hormones this is a major effect on her body image/confidence and many other things.
Anyways, my aunt is a terrible parent. My uncle? He never wanted children and it really shows, which leave a bad impression on my cousins. My aunt is trying to get Mary diagnosed with something, ANYTHING, because she is in such a deep denial and cannot point the fingers at herself that she went wrong with babying my cousin so now she has the mentality of a 7 year old at best. They went to a psychiatrist and she got ""diagnosed"" with aspergers and OCD. She wont talk to anyone because shes not encuraged to nor was ever taught the social means to do so. There is no way in hell she has either of these things. My aunt was even wanting to put her on meds she doesn't need. Also she isn't encouraged at all to go to school, she sits at home all day on the computer. This is getting to a point where i'm getting mentally sick of seeing this going on in front of my eyes, that my cousin, is doing this. This is abuse.

My wife and I have about $2,700 in medical bills (after insurance) for having a baby.  

I recently applied for a new credit card that has a 15-month zero interest period specifically to handle these expenses, so if need be I can pay this and pay down the debt prior to the 15 months expiring.

I am a 23 year old who graduated from college in 2010 with no clue about what I wanted to do with my life and have yet to apply for a single job. After spending the last year burdened by family duties and slipping into a deep depression, I am in desperate need for an adventure. I am tired of sitting at home wallowing in depression and letting my family suck what little energy I have left in me. So I'm bustin outta this joint.

I've decided to start in my hometown in California and attempt to hitchhike/CouchSurf/wwoof my way down to South America. I am not making any definite plans and I am open to going just about anywhere while loosely attempting to head south. I hope to CouchSurf as much as possible, but part of the adventure for me is to have the freedom and flexibility of no plans so that may be difficult since I will not have a schedule.

My original plan was to fly to somewhere in Central America and start from there, but I just can't afford the flight. Which brings up another issue: I am leaving with only hundreds of dollars to my name.

Let me start at the beginning. My boyfriend and I adopted our cat Spike in January of this year from the shelter, he will be a year old in October.

We moved from Indiana to Texas this May to a home with 1 cat and her litter of 5 kittens.

Until he started doing it on our bed. Every day. Took him to the vet to check everything out and he has a UTI. Started him on antibiotics about a week ago. For a few days he was going back in the box (we uncovered it and clean it everyday). A couple days ago, he peed on the pillows so they got thrown in the washer. Then last night, right in front of me, he peed on the sheets. Depending on if he stops or not, he's scheduled for another UA on Tuesday. Money is a factor right now. Me and boyfriend were wondering if there was anything we could use to discourage him from peeing on the bed again. We were going to look into Feliaway but have read mixed reviews and dont want to spend money we dont have on something that may or may not work. Hes fine with the kittens, he loves playing with them. So anything that wont cost an arm and a leg would be greatly appreciated.

This story has a timeline of two weeks, starting a week ago on Monday June 1st. I live in Australia, where it is now Thursday 11th. 

Last Monday, I got an interview for a non-advertised entry position at my dream company. All of the stars aligned: It was an emergency for them and I responded the fastest thanks to a friend of a friend that works at said company. 

After presenting them my portfolio, the three people I met with were very enthusiastic, to the point of showing me around the office and introducing me to people. I was told I'd be contacted the following day. 

On Tuesday, I was informed they'd been able to resolve the issue internally but wanted to bring me on board anyway for another project. I was told we would speak very soon. 

On Friday (of what was a long weekend), I was emailed after work hours told that an opportunity had come up for me to come on board and would be contacted on Tuesday. I replied thanking them and saying I hoped to hear from them on Tuesday. 

Tuesday came and went with no phone call or no email. I let it pass because Tuesday was the starting day of the project I was initially being interviewed for (I imagined they were busy trying to make sure it started out right and hadn't had time to get in touch). 

Wednesday passed and I wasn't contacted. 

It is Thursday after lunch and I'm thinking of dropping the person who emailed me last just checking in. 

Should I email today or wait till tomorrow?","This person had a very promising interview experience, receiving an offer to join a company they've been following for a long time.

Been lurking for close to a year now, I recently found this subreddit and the advice I've found around here is simply fantastic. I think this is the subreddit for this, if not, sorry!

I've devoured most top links and started reading ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" and I'm loving it so far (A Random Walk, Intelligent Investor, and Millionare Next Door are on the list). It comes at great time since I've been meaning to get my first credit card and savings account. 

Now, the thing is that while the advice is sound and I can follow the general outline of it, things in Mexico are different. For one, I can't seem to find anything similar to a Roth IRA in that it's tax free. Also, creditdit lines, APYs and pretty much everything is inferior.

I have always done my own taxes. My father always did his, and, throughout my childhood, I had a helping hand. As the world began to transition into the land of the Internet Of Things, my father would do his pen and paper taxes, then have me help him translate that into TurboTax. He would scrutinize and, once he was satisfied, we would submit his return and I would get cake.

As I grew up, this is how I always filed my own personal income tax returns. Fairly straightforward. Many people do it. It's always worked for me, I've never run into any serious problems, I've always gotten a return (although it's never enough, but whose is?)

This year, however, is a complicated tax year for me. I moved to a state that charges state income tax with my previous employer. They took care of the state taxes on the front end, but I ended my employment with them in August and have been working since then employed elsewhere, so the state taxes for that portion of the year were not taken care of. I also cashed in my 401k early. I know, it's a big no-no, but sometimes you really have to, and I did. 

I earned no other income than what was earned through employment with companies one and two. I earned no out of state income this year.

My University is small, so the Music Industry major is simply a combination of a Music Business and Music Technology. I'm a Sophomore (36 Credits) and I still have a little bit of time to change my schedule before the summer ends. I've been thinking about changing my major from English Education to Music Industry essentially since I discovered that that was a major. I've always had a passion for working with people younger than me and for reading and writing and general English things, and to be quite honest, I'm very good at it - to the point where those classes are too easy for me. However, my main reason for truly becoming a teacher is because I've never had a good English teacher, and I want to put more good English teachers into the world. But then I joined a Music Fraternity; and on my campus, my Fraternity is in charge of all things Sound related - at least Technology-wise. And we essentially ""run"" two out of three variety shows a year, and while I was working these I found myself absolutely mesmorized by working sound and running wires and equipment and everything else. I especially enjoyed the seemingly mind-numbing task of running XLRs along the stage, simply because I didn't really have the know-how to do anything else. But honestly I was so interested in learning more and I just had such a good time running these shows that I'm worried about how much I'd actually enjoy teaching.

If it helps, I worked out a three-year plan, and I'll graduate on time - assuming I take the Business courses (about four of them) and my Internship (Four Credits) over next Summer.

I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying ""I'm a TV watcher"" or ""music listener."" Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous.

So I interviewed for a position last week, and before the interview I saw online that the industry average for this position was $41,000. During the interview, they asked me my salary expectations, I said between $38,000 and $45,000 hoping it'd land somewhere in the middle. I received my offer today, and it was for $38,000. I can't help but wonder if I had just said $41,000 they probably would've offered it...

Anyways, so what I know is they are hiring 3 other people for this same position... I either got lucky and guessed exactly what salary they were planning on paying all of us to begin with, or we're all getting paid differently. As for the job, it is the ideal entry level position for me right now, and is a great company with benefits etc so I actually wouldn't mind working there for the 38k salary.

But it would be nice to get an even 40 at least, so my question is, is it common practice to negotiate salary after receiving an offer already?

**Notice: I mean no disrespect to fans so please don't take this the wrong way.**

...but I'm more than open to having my mind changed if someone can explain to me what I'm missing.

My job has an hour-long commute, so I joined the library and have been going through podcasts and audiobooks like crazy. 

While sifting through their audiobook collection I saw they had all of the LOTR books, which I've never read -- I wanted to as a teenager but never got around to it. I never watched the movies because I wanted to read the books first because I'm a nerd like that. I knew absolutely nothing about the series other than the brief introduction I had to it while playing the Interplay LOTR adventure game on PC in the mid-90's for half an hour once.

So for the first few discs I found it a little monotonous. Lots of awkward singing by the narrator, lots of painfully long descriptions of the Shire and lots of genealogy for minor characters, which I found odd. But I assumed it'd pick up since I had 14 discs left to go.

I'm currently on disc 9 (right as they're getting to Rivendell) but I absolutely cannot get interested in it, though not for lack of trying. Each commute it gets more difficult for me to keep listening rather than just throw on music or the news. Every time I get to a new disc I feel like I just finished several hours of homework and I have to bargain with myself to start the next one. 

It's not that I don't like it. I like Tolkien's style, the characters are ridiculously well-developed and I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was in the 1950's...I just can't figure out what's so interesting and exciting about it to so many people, and I certainly can't imagine spending 50+ more hours finishing out the entire trilogy. 

Can someone change my mind before I bail and take it back to the library on Tuesday? 

If it matters in your analysis, my normal taste is Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and non-fiction about science, politics and religion. My favorite book is Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett.","This post is a lament about a fan's frustration with a long audiobook series, specifically the LOTR, and their inability to connect with the narrative.

My predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.

I am a Canadian living and working in a small town that is...quite frankly, really boring.  There's just not much going on!  When I finished high school, I went and worked at a bed and breakfast in PEI.  That was nice, but still really quiet.  When the season ended, I went to Scotland and then went around the UK for 2 months.  It was awesome!  I loved the whole experience, but I especially liked London.  The hustle and bustle of the city, the sheer numbers of people, the transport, the pubs, everything.  There always something to see or do!  I ended up going back to Europe a few months later (for 2.5 months).  Thing is...I still haven't got it out of my system!

So there's the 3rd anniversary of a full, half, 10k, 5k, etc going on this weekend in strikingly beautiful Shepherdstown, WV, which is near my hometown so my dad (an ex-distance runner...he'd average 3 a year back in the day) signed he and I up and I was planning to run it super slow, as I have 12 on the [Hal Higdon Novice 1 training schedule] this weekend before a 2 week taper prior to Baltimore.  

My first 20 mile run ever this past weekend felt good, and the 14 the week before felt great.  I'm slightly overweight and not as dedicated as I should be-i.e., I have definitely not 'overtrained'-so my marathon plans are more or less to finish and to try to hit 4:20.  My long runs like the 20 miler were around a 10 minute pace...but I feel really good right now and am thinking I could really kick this half marathon's ass if i put my mind to it.  

I ran it in 1:58 last year (9:03) and if I tried I'm pretty sure I could improve upon that.   The question is...should I try?  All this work has been to lead up to the marathon, and following a schedule I have been astonished with my recovery ability, so I'm looking for advice on this.","This person is planning to run a series of half marathons, including a 10k and a 5k, to prepare for a marathon.

Hello all, and thanks in advance. So, I have been an athlete my whole life, started competitive soccer and other sports when I was 5 (27 now), and have always considered myself physically fit. About 4 years ago, I moved to Hawaii and basically became a beach potato with almost no consistent physical activity for the first time in my life. A year and a half ago, I had a baby with my fiance, moved back to the Mainland, and decided I needed to get my life on track for the benefit of my child (now children). So I quit smoking tobacco and signed up for a half marathon. I was doing my best to follow a training program I found on Garmin Connect, but about 8 weeks into the training I started pushing too hard, running too many miles too fast, a classic rookie maneuver, I know, but it felt so good to build strength in my body and I began to rely on the peaceful solace I found running alone, away from the chaos of raising now 2 small children. Anyway, after a nice long run, a hot shower and a nap, I squatted slightly to pick up my son, and I felt a *pop* in my 2nd toe on my left foot. It swelled immediately, and was painful to walk on, let alone run, for (the past) 6-7 weeks, and although MUCH improved this past 2 weeks, I still feel it occasionally. I did some research and I think it may be either Metatarsalgia or Capsulitis, the symptoms match both somewhat. So my questions are these: would it be stupid to try and run again before the symptoms completely dissipate? and when I do start running again, what mileage is safe? Should I start with a c25k (really don't want to be re-injured)? I was running 5-6 miles 4 days a week, with a long run about 8 miles, again, from not running in years in about an 8-10 week span.
Thanks for the help, and all the inspiration and motivation! (longtime lurker here)","This individual experienced a sudden onset of pain in their second toe after a period of inactivity and pushing too hard during a half marathon training program.

So I'll be filing my won taxes for the first time, and I'm a little confused because of the way I make money. I work online and get paid with either btc or paypal. When I get paid with bitcoin, I sell in on localbitcoins for either cash or gold/silver bullion. I've had some issues with paypal before, and because of this I don't add all my personal/banking info.

I have money in my checking/savings account that I use for bills/expenses, so all the money I have made this year is in gold/silver.

So my boyfriends family are pretty terrible people. His mother is a complete irresponsible mother (she's lost 2 children to the state), and my boyfriend has never had a relationship with them.

I spent four years living half a country away from my parents, and those four years were great, but expensive. So when my parents moved closer to me, I moved in with them, looking to save money and finish school. 

It's been going pretty well. I go to church with them once a week (they're fundamentalist Christians), I don't drink or go to parties and I work to pay for school. They cover my room and board, and occasionally drive me around. 

Last week however, I had a friend come up from Toronto, (about an hour and a half away.) I went to a movie with said friend (Magic Mike) and told my parents I was going to see Abe Lincoln. Ignoring the fact that it's not as terrible as it sounds, that I'm 22 and lying to my parents, my mother somehow found out.

In need of a little advice here. Back in 2009 my current girlfriend and I graduated from college, me with a degree in accounting and her with a degree in marketing. It took me roughly a year to land a job in my career field; my girlfriend, however, was not so lucky. Taking menial and tedious jobs she tried to make the most of it. 

Fast forward to 2012, she accepts a part-time job and makes the decision to return to school. This time, however, to take courses for her to able to attend Pharmacy school.

Enrolling as a part-time student, she takes the necessary classes she needs to meet her Pharmacy prerequisites. However, because of the weird curriculum of her university, one of her classes doesn't meet the Pharmacy requirements and so ultimately she drops it in favor of a class that does. 

Twist occurs when it turns out the class that met her Pharmacy prerequisite does not meet her university's prerequisite for the upper level classes she needs. So now she has to take additional classes just to meet those prerequisites. This of course means that it will take her longer to take her PCATs and ultimately longer to get into Pharmacy school. She doesn't want to be in school the rest of her twenties nor does she want to be burdened with additional debt/expenses while reaching her goal. 

I guess I'm unsure of what to do; I try to be supportive as possible, hearing her out, letting her express her frustrations but it doesn't seem to work. What are her or my options here?

So I've only been running since about May or so. Lost 60 lbs in the process and worked my way up to be able to do the Leavenworth Oktoberfest half Mary this past Saturday. 

Perfect weather, sunny, a little chilly to start. I felt great and had what I considered a fairly lofty goal of 1:45 (8 minute mile x 13.1)

Spent the miles chasing this older lady who didn't look like she should've been able to run as fast as she did. Passed her towards the end in a full on sprint to the finish. I felt awesome! Looked at my time and saw 1:37.

Man it felt nice. But I found out a couple days later that someone working the route didn't know what they were doing and didn't direct runners down a little .8 mile dog leg. So I (and apparently a LOT of other people) only ran 12.3! Man I'm bummed. I would've gladly given up making it under my goal time in exchange for actually having run the full course! At least I have my plans for this weekend... I'm running a full 13.1 so I can finally say truthfully that I did it and get over the feeling of being cheated.

So a friend and I are flying into Amsterdam, and then leaving on a flight out of Berlin. So minus airplane travel, that is like 13-14 days in between.

Throw away for reasons.

I got a notice in the mail today saying that I owe $850 in taxes from 2012.

I somehow missed an entire W2 (I work freelance and have several anywhere from 3-12 employers each year), as well as some 1099-G income! I can see why I got audited or whatever, even just taking the standard deduction. My actual income was nearly double that of my reported income. 

Long story, but my dad had me cash a lottery ticket for him for $4000. He gave me a couple hundred to do it, but I'm realizing it was probably a bad call now.

I have 2 dogs. One loves everyone (after he growls and barks at you) and the other one trusts NO ONE but me. I got them both from the SPCA. The skittish dog is a Shiba Inu/Italian Greyhound mix and he's always been afraid of pretty much everything. 
        When I brought him home he immediately hid underneath my bed but I won his trust with some bread crusts and after that he's been my shadow.

Hi, here is some background info on me.
Due to my weight I have gone to the ER for the first time at 19 due to chest pain, and twitching(thought I was dying). The doctors said it was from stress, and that I need to learn how to not be so stressed out.

I am financially stable so I would have no problems if I quit this job, or if I can't find a job right after I quit this one. This is an administrative job that gives out extremely odd hours. Some weeks I'll be working tons, but the next I'll have no hours. There has also been changes in management recently and as I have received sparse hours, I am extremely out of the loop with the new changes. I have been working for this job for 7 months now. I feel that this company will not help me grow and I have no interest in staying. I have helped the company improve inventory management, as well as their site. I also do bookkeeping. My question is if I quite this job right now how would it affect my chances of getting a job in the future, especially since I don't intend to get another job until I graduate? Also, would the amount of time I've worked at the company affect the decision of future employers ?

So, long story short, about three weeks ago I was written a misdemeanor citation for possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia. This was after work and was not on property or anything. Anyways, fast forward three weeks to today and I am called into the office. My boss found out about it and I was given the option to either be fired or to resign. I obviously went with the latter.

My question is, how should I approach this if asked about it in the future? My supervisor (not the same person as the boss that ""fired"" me) said that he'd still be willing to let me continue to use him as a reference. Him and I got along well and I was never a problem at work (in fact, I was quite the opposite) so I still think he will give me a good review if questioned. 

Anyways, I have a phone interview this Friday (thank god) and am just wondering how I should approach this problem. There's no way that they know about it and I'm sure they just think I'm still working there. Obviously I'm not going to bring it up but if they ask me about my work there, should I just tell them that I don't work there anymore? Should I be honest and say I resigned? I guess another thing I have going for me is that I never *technically* was fired...I resigned. Anyways, what do you guys think?","This individual has been recently involved in a misdemeanor incident, which has resulted in a resignation.

Hey guys, first time posting here so lmk if I'm doing anything wrong! I'm 23 years old and I just graduated from my bachelor's program, so I'm back at home for the year. I'm applying to dental schools in the states (but Canadian) for next September, so I'll be living at home for the next 16 months and I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've been back for 3 months and I already feel so suffocated and I'm being treated like a child. My dad is very controlling and doesn't want me to stay out of the house past 10pm (yes, I'm 23). He always wants me home on time and we have already gotten into many fights about this because he is very firm with it. I have a boyfriend and I have a life, and last night we got into a huge fight and he told me to either be home at 10pm latest every night or pack my bags and move out. I wish I could just find a job with my degree and have a salary and be independent, but that's not the case. I'm going to need him to co-sign dental loans next year and I'm scared if I move out he won't want to take me back in and help with the loans. Also, I'm currently studying for the DAT, so I don't work that many hours a week.. so I'm very low on money and I couldn't even afford rent. Should I look into a line of credit and maybe do that for the next 16 months? Or should I just suck it up and live at home because I need those dental loans and don't want to get on his bad side. I'm not sure if there are any other options to be financially independent...

First time posting on Reddit and on mobile, formatting might be a problem.
Yesterday, I checked my bank account online after my card was not accepted for a payment. Turns out I have a balance of -$60 on my debit card because of a purchase done on a subscription I didn't even know I had subscribed to. I only had 0.23¢ (irresponsible, I know) on my bank account, and the subscription costed $12. So apart from the $12 fee, I got an overdraft fee of -$34, and another more for -$15 after not paying the first fee a week after I got it. So now I have a $60 fee, and I have no idea if it will affect my credit or my debit in any way. I do not have a credit card, I have never had any, and I plan to pay the debt today. Will this fee affect me and my credit in any way?","This user is experiencing a significant financial issue with a subscription they didn't realize they had, resulting in a substantial overdraft fee and a series of charges.

I have been in school to get a Bachelors of Science in communication through my school's film/video program. I have always had a love for story telling and filmmaking. 

However, more and more I realize that I am a storyteller first, and a filmmaker second. I have no desire to be in production. The two things I love are creating a story in pre-production and editing that story in the editing room during post-production. I have no *real* intention on being at production. I have been contemplating whether or not to switch my major. I haven't looked into it, but I know it will push me back at least a year (I am a junior). I am on my own as far as paying for my school and housing. I am worried switching my major is not a good choice, or even feasible without piling on more debt. 

On the flip side, I love to write, I love making up stories and I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I could also say the same about post-production in film though.

I was hoping to get some advice on what the best way in figuring out what exactly is best for me to make the best decision for me. Maybe some of you have been in a similar experience and can shed some light on the issue from your perspective.

I work in special education, specifically with emotionally disturbed kids. The past 6 months all of my students who were in foster found potential permanent homes. Sounds great right? Even better, all of those homes ended up working out, in each case the new parents were ready to sign the dotted line and take on the responsibility of a victim of trauma. Even better still; all but one of the families were in district, so I would be able to continue working with the students (some of them I've been with for 4 years now). Can this get any better? Yes, my students would finally have someone to call ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" or both. 

Only we discovered a problem, a major problem. Once an adoption is finalized, all funding and resources coming from the state to pay for things like Therapy are completely cut. That means you take a child who from birth to the age of 5 was sexually and physically abused, put them into the system, get them finally comfortable opening up to a therapist, get the ball rolling so they are making serious educational and emotional progress, find them a placement, then cut all those supports out from underneath them. How is that fair to the child or the families who want to adopt those children? 

Just today I had a meeting with the entire support team for one of these children and, being the case manager I had to inform the potential adoptive parents that the entire financial burden of continued treatment will be solely on them. Basically, I have to help these people cheat the system in order to best serve my students. It feels really unethical to me, and I feel like it really disappoints the students when they're not officially adopted, they crave safe permanency.

So I do most of my browsing on reddit through my phone.  For the most part it is great although it often takes quite a bit of time to load images.  This is where I came up with an idea for a content sharing service.
  
So take [something like this] which is about 150KB.  This isn't that big of a picture but it could still take some time to load if the network is congested.  I take the same amount of content and added it [here]  This came out to ~7.5KB.  This should be able to load just about instantly on a phone.  This is a fairly small example as I have seen some images that span multiple pages and take forever to load on my phone.
  
So the benefits of the service are
  
* Must faster load times on mobile devices.
* The pages are rendered in a mobile/tablet friendly layout.
* I keep the original styling
* I link to the original source
* Sites with low bandwidth wouldn't feel the pain of the reddit effect
  
  
Anyway, let me know what you think.  Also if anyone has a better idea for a name of the site let me know.
  
If reddit likes this idea I will keep developing.  I know that right now it is pretty slow when you actually select some content and doesn't work on all sites.  This was just a prototype and I have a ton of ideas on how to speed up the site.  I will also give the UI/UX a refresh by getting some help from a graphic artist.","This post is about an idea for a content sharing service that aims to improve mobile loading times on Reddit.

My wife and I are both college educated. Neither of us are idiots, and we've been casually browsing the 'self-help' budgets around these parts and nothing really seems to hit home. I think this is partially because I have avoidance issues, and am a bit embarrassed by how illiterate I've allowed myself to be (financially) as an adult.

Hey everyone, I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Nursing from a private, 4 year college. I had to take out the Government loans as well as private loans. I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here,  this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. 

 The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.

 I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?

The other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? 

Also, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans.","This post is about a nursing graduate who has taken out private loans and government loans, and they are trying to strategize about paying off their debts.

My girlfriend and I met last year at the orientation for our doctoral Biochemistry program. She's from northern Virginia, where the deer tick-borne Borrelia bacterium causative in Lyme Disease is a real problem. She told me her stupid neighbors were seen feeding deer. Dumb. That's another story, though.

The treatment so far has involved several 9-week regimens of antibiotic cocktails, supplements, and probiotics. I remember one antibiotic she was taking that looked like yellow paint she had to squirt 10 mL of into her mouth twice a day. She said it tasted godawful, too. She's been miserable every day and makes me look like a total baby, because I stay home if I have a tummy-ache and she constantly works about 40 hours a week in lab.

Along with Lyme Disease, she has Gastroparesis, which severely limits what she can eat. In addition, the doctor told her that she shouldn't eat food with gluten because she may become allergic to it as a result of this treatment. Usually, she just eats rice products and yogurt.

Hi. I'm 23, male.

I knew her since i was like 14, she was a year younger than me. We used to hang out almost daily for years - she lived just down the road from me. We were really good friends, and our friendship lasted until i was about 19. I was a really naive teen, and never realized she had feelings for me, even though she gave some massive signals. 

I had strong emotional feelings for her too, but i didn't really understand them at the time. I was a late bloomer. I went through a lot of hardships  and i slipped into a bit of a destructive state. I ended up pushing her away, i did it to protect her, but it ruined our friendship. I imagine she hates me now. 

I've only seen her once since (been 5 years), and we both completely blanked each other. I haven't attempted to contact her or anything, i could quite easily, but i don't want to talk to her and find out she hates me now. I still think about her a fair bit, and even have dreams about her. (non sexual). I know it's weird, but i'm not stalking her or involving her in any way so it's not hurting, right? 

Well, that's the past. The present is the problem. I don't feel attracted to anybody, sexually or emotionally. I have options, i'm not bad looking and i get interest on nights out, and a couple of friends who like me. But none of them interest me.

Hello Reddit,

First time poster in this subreddit. It's been a about 14 months since I've graduated undergraduate, and I've been having trouble finding an entry level, full time position in either marketing or sales. When I first graduated, I had a fair share of interviews and recruiters contacting me, but I had received no formal offer or I ended up through the process realizing the company might not be a good fit.

I'm underemployed at the moment working a job paying $13/hr that doesn't require a Bachelor's degree, so I'm keeping my head above water in paying my student loans and other bills, but just barely. I live at home and I am saving money, but I can't help but feel discouraged that I ""SHOULD"" have a salaried position at this point, but I don't.

I tweak my resume to the job description with keywords, I actively use LinkedIn, reach out for networking, and nothing seems to materialize other than the automated rejection email sent by computers. 

I apply to at the very least, 2 jobs per week, and I feel like my resume doesn't even get glanced upon by human eyes at this point, even when I include a personalized cover letter with my application. I'm wondering if there are any other redditers on here with similar experiences struggling to find their ""career"" jobs as well within their recent years of post undergraduate life, because sometimes I feel like I might be the only one.

Long time lurker, first post ever. I'm looking for a bit of help trying to figure out if this potential job is legitimate. Regardless of my desperation, I'm typically rational when it comes to making big life decisions but last week, I received an email from a recruiter about a potential ""Project Management"" position from a VC from Delaware and all I had to do was apply on their website if I was interested. I was already sketched out but 2 things checked out: 1. Recruiter had a corporate email and 2. The website seemed really legit, so I thought that it wouldn't hurt to apply. There was no financial information requested, only my address and phone number as well as my references.

On Monday, I received another email, asking to schedule a phone interview. At this point, a lot of emotions take over and I request for a call at their soonest availability. The next day, I receive the call right on schedule by a female with a heavy Russian-ish accent. I was asked a couple basic questions like my typical workday and my career goals. It was very brief, 8-10 minutes but I immediately felt that I was being scammed. After the phone call I do even more research and found that the site has been active for only 21 days.

Today, I got an email about the next step from a Sr. in Human Resources. Attached was a contract for a one-month paid training which is apparently a part of their ""screening process"" before they decide to hire full time. Again no financial info was asked from me, just e-sign the document.

The document says that the corporate address is in Kowloon and I haven't been able to find ANY contacts on linkedin but they included a bunch of address for the new office in Los Angeles. I'm going to call all the numbers to see if I could speak with anyone. How should I go about all of this to find out if this is a real job and also a what is the best way to protect myself if it isn't?","This post is a warning about a potential scam.

Hey everyone, I was hoping to gather some tips from people who left running and had to start over. 

A semi-lengthy background on myself to help you understand where I am coming from. In high school I was a very good cross country runner, running from 35-50 miles a week and never slower than 8-9 minute miles. At the end of senior year, I planned on taking a break from running and then try to race half or full marathons in the spring. I ended up not running at all after xc. 4 years later, I was noticing how much I miss the sport (especially after seeing the success of xc friends) so I decided to join a running group to get back into it. But the only group at my university that I could find was a triathlon club. I joined them, but only did the running workouts. After about 4 weeks, I developed shin splints. This is because I haven't ran in 4 years but thought 6 miles was ok after 4 weeks. Also, being 25 pounds heavier didnt help. After taking 3 months off and training on the bike and in the pool, I finally was back to running in february. but my shinsplints was still around. I finished my first sprint triathlon last week, and have been trying to get miles back under my feet again. I havent felt shin splints severely since the beginning of March, but I can feel it looming around. After a half year of it, I am getting really really frustrated. I cant run more than 4 miles still and my fastest mile is 8 minutes. I know I will probably never run like I did when I was 17, but its difficult because of remembering what I used to be capable of running.","This individual has been running for a long time, had a successful high school running career, but has struggled to regain their previous fitness level and is experiencing shin splints, leading to frustration and a desire to return to running.","The author is a runner who has experienced a significant setback in their running career, starting with a high level of performance and a strong desire to return to running.

Hello everyone, I hope that you guys can give me some guidance on an important decision I have to make. I have been working for 11 months at a big accounting firm. My background is in IT and wanted to do something more closely related to technology. I started interviewing and I received an offer for $7K more than what I am currently making. This came as great news, except I just learned that HR is going to get me an opportunity within my current firm to do something a lot cooler but I'd keep the same salary. The problem with the new offer is the distance to my current place and where my SO lives. I live currently close to Downtown and she lives 30 minutes south, the new job would be 40 minutes north west of where I currently live. Just before I got the offer I was looking to move closer to her, but that would mean about 1.5 hrs of driving every day. I have made numbers and the raise covers the price of gas. Is there anything I should do in addition to that to be able to make a better decision? I feel like if I stay at my current firm I'll be able to get an even bigger raise if I move out in the next few years, but not sure that this is the case. I'm confident since unemployment numbers are steadily going down every day.

So, I've been in a relationship with my (now ex) girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years and it just ended suddenly tonight. I guess it was because of a lot of stuff that's been building up throughout our relationship. It is long distance because I'm away at college so I definitely understand why things went sour. For clarification, I broke up with her. She was fairly controlling throughout our relationship and was also extremely clingy. I never really got any appreciation for the stuff I did for her and she is also an extremely jealous person. I'm the only person that she has to rely on when she needs someone and she expects me to be at her side at the drop of a hat. We had different views on a lot of things, including religion, marriage, and children, but we were extremely serious and considering engagement in the future. Fiscally, she wasn't really appropriate for me because she is a rather large spender while I prefer to save our money. Unfortunately, I would give in on these whims and now I don't really have much to show for working throughout my high school career. Although things haven't been that good for us when we are away from one another, they are typically really good when we are together. After breaking up with her, she told me that she was going to change everything that I dislike about her because she had figured all of this out already and was wanting to fix it before anything bad happened. I told her that it was a little too late because these problems have come up before and they were never fixed, but she insisted that she would keep trying she also said that she hopes that we can get back together some time in the future. I really don't know how to handle the situation, Reddit. Can you help me out? Do I stay friends with her? Do I give her another chance?

Hey all, first time post here.  Just wanted to share my DirecTV experience in the hope of helping out anyone else that might be considering signing up.

I joined DirecTV a little over year ago because I had grown extremely dissatisfied with Time Warner Cable.  One the the incentives/perks DirecTV offers to new customers is a free season of their NFL Sunday Ticket package.  This is a nice perk for many people I guess, but not really useful for me because I follow the local team and all the games are on local broadcast TV.

Fast forward to this year, I looked at my October billing statement and found out that DirecTV has been charging me $40/month for the past several months for the fucking NFL Sunday Ticket package that I did not choose to renew! I have auto pay, so I don't normally look at my bill very closely and didn't notice until my October statement. I called customer service and had to speak to four different levels of people before I finally got someone who said she would take care of it for me.  The call took more than 45 minutes and was beyond frustrating.  

Two weeks later I received my next bill and, you guessed it.  There is another $40 charge on there for NFL Sunday Ticket.  I called back in and found that the first three people I had spoken to on my previous call had noted the account, up to the point that they told me the most they could do was credit me for half of the charges.  The final supervisor I spoke to never noted the account - how convenient.  I ended up spending another 55 minutes on the phone and talked to another four people, but never got anyone to offer anything other than crediting me for half the charges.  At this point I am going to file a small claims suit against DirectTV and will be cancelling my service as soon as my contract is up in July.","This post is a complaint about DirecTV's billing practices, specifically the unauthorized charge for NFL Sunday Ticket, and the frustrating customer service experience.

Apologies in advance for the length and I would like to note that I do have plans to talk to various people at my university but I would like to hear from fellow Redditors who have perhaps been in similar situations.
Anyways, here's my situation:

I am currently a sophomore graphic design major. When I graduated high school I thought for sure that graphic design was what I wanted to do but after getting a little farther into the program and looking ahead, I've decided that it's not something I want to continue with.

For those wondering why I don't want to continue, I'm honestly just not as passionate about graphic design and the time commitment is causing me a lot of stress. I hate to sound lazy, but I want a major/to take classes that will allow me to have a life. I've even found myself wishing I had papers to write.

With that being said, I am not 100% what I would want to switch majors to, but I do have some ideas. At the same time, I don't want to completely switch to another major only to find out that once again it's not what I like. I am definitely finishing out this semester in my graphics classes and I plan on putting forth effort, but I'm not as concerned about whether or not my projects are ""portfolio-material.""

Here is what I am thinking about doing for next semester:
I have not taken a ton of general education courses so I am wanting to take a variety of classes that interest me and also fulfill general education requirements. Of the possible majors I am thinking of switching to, some of these general education classes do apply to them or fit in the same category. Is this a good idea? Like I mentioned before, I don't want to completely throw myself into a different major in the event that it's not what I'm interested in.","This student is a sophomore graphic design major who has realized they don't want to continue with the program and is exploring alternative paths.

I proposed last weekend. We've talked about it for a long time, I just finally got around to doing it. 

Now to the important stuff. We've been together for over 5 years, lived together for four. She's extremely responsible with her money, which is one of the reasons I haven't really thought I needed one. She pays me a set amount a month for rent, we just kind of split other things like groceries and such. I'd say I generally pay for going out to eat, vacations, etc. But I make a lot more than she does, so I don't have a problem with that. Even though we have separate accounts, I'd say we both consider things ours. I do own a house, but like I said, she's paying a little over a 3rd of that payment a month.

I don't want to sound like I have love blinders on, I'm a pessimist generally, but I can't really see the need for one. If something ever did happen where we got divorced, which I really can't see but I know people change, should I still get one? Honestly if that happened, I know myself, and I'd be civil and fair about who get's what, I could guarantee that. I really couldn't see her being any other way either, we're a lot a like that way.

We're not going to have kids, and if we did split, I'd feel she was owed at minimum, all of the money she paid towards the house, if not half of the house itself. 

So, should I still look into getting one? Feel free to be as critical as possible about my views on things. She already asked me if I wanted one, as I technically have more assets than her (even though I consider them ours), so getting one wouldn't be an issue. I feel the fact that she asked that speaks to her financial responsibility.","This person is considering getting a pet, but has a complex relationship with their partner and is wary of divorce.

Recently, my mother asked for a loan from me and my sibling to get her and my father out of debt, but I'm not entirely sure if we should or not? It's somewhat substantial (around 30k, so 15k from my sibling and me), and while we can afford to do so I'm not sure it's something that we should absolutely do. My mother offered to write up a contract to pay us back over the span of three years; she even suggested a decent annual interest rate of 5 percent. 

My hesitation lies primarily with her spending habits. While I'm fairly confident in her promise to pay back the loan in full, I feel that she is only asking this because she recently discovered our financial situation and realized that we can afford to essentially bail her out. While her spending habits are not too crazy, she often splurges on trips and eats out a fair amount and will often buy things she doesn't need. Currently, my parents are saving up for a fancy motorcycle, although my mother has assured me that they are not planning on buying it anytime soon. I'm worried that she will use our money to pay off her debts without adopting more frugal habits as a result (and perhaps even splurging on the motorcycle).

I'm mostly feeling obligated because my parents paid for both of our college tuitions (at great financial stress), but I also feel like if she adopted a decent financial plan they could pay off their debts on their own.","This post expresses a complex situation where a family is considering a loan to alleviate their debts, with a significant amount of money involved.

Going anon for all the obvious reasons. Also, apologies to the men--you may want to shuffle awkwardly away now...

Needing some advice from the ladies: I have hit a serious chafing issue. I have been increasing mileage, up to 20 mpw at the moment. For the last few weeks, my long run has been KILLING my (admittedly larger than average) inner labia. Like, road rash.

I wear compression shorts and no underpants at the moment--this has been my go-to solution for a really large butt that manages to pull down every pair of running shorts I have ever tried. However, now my ladybits are objecting: anyone have any alternative suggestions?

With underpants, they always just kept sliding down for the whole damn run.

With a decent income tax coming in the next few weeks I've decided to take care of 2 derogatory marks on my credit report from 2 debts that have gone into collections, one for a good 3-4 years at least and the other being from about a year ago, maybe 2 years ago. I am receiving 1500$ in my tax return and would like to handle my 2 outstanding debts of collectively $1000 ($700  & $300 each debt with a different agency.)

Hey guys,

I really hope this is considered the right subreddit for this type of question.

Long story short, my current Financial Planner is an old friend of mine. We recently had a fairly serious falling out and now I'm worried that my funds could potentially be jeopardized because emotion is involved.

I've got a bit of a dilemma on my hands and I'm not sure where to go with it.

I graduated about a year ago with a bachelor's degree in Communication and I live in the Midwest. While that's typically not a great degree in this economy or this area, I've been employed by a very well-known and respected ad agency for a little over six months now. My internship in college was in NYC with one of the big TV news outlets. Not trying to be cocky, but I have a good resume for being a year out of school and I'm really, really trying to preserve it. 

I'm extremely thankful for being employed. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate where I'm at when I see so many on this subreddit suffering in unemployment. But I'm genuinely unhappy. I find advertising to be wholly unrewarding, soul-crushing and morally bankrupt. I sell unhappiness and consumerism for a living in a high-stress, low-pay environment and it's starting to affect who I am outside of work.

When I first graduated I was trying to get back to NYC where I'd done my internship and now I'm really considering giving it a try once again. 

However, I've only been at this job for a little over 6 months and I'm worried that 1) it's going to make me look like a job jumper and 2) nobody will take me seriously. Maybe this shows my age and immaturity, but I know that if I got hit by a bus tomorrow I'd regret sitting in a cubicle for 50 hours a week and not going after a dream.

Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice? Tough love?","This individual is facing a significant dilemma, having recently graduated with a communication degree and working in a high-pressure advertising agency.

I got my rat terrier (Bella) in 2006, she was about 6 months. My parents got her for a early birthday gift.  This was my first dog, and I was in 6th grade when I got her. Recently she's been acting different. I know she's old, but I read that rat terrier's life expectancy is 17-24 years old on google. She hasn't been to the vet ever, my parents don't have extra money for vet fees and pills for dogs. Other than that she has been a happy lively gal.  Here are some symptoms:
-Walks slow and responds slow; she barely even does what I tell her to do for a treat like roll over or sit. She just looks at me.
-she has slipped walking to the kitchen on our tile.
-She pee's quite frequently on the carpet.
-She lost most of her front teeth by now and her back molars are rotting. 
-She doesn't run to the door when someone rings the door bell.

I am quite worried about her because she could not make it into the house after a walk this morning, a small step up into the doorway. I am thinking about going to the vet and seeing what's wrong with her this weekend. With my own money, I am a broke college student but I can't bear to see my baby like this. I almost had a panic attack on my way home because my mom didn't come straight home after work. She was left alone. 

I've been trying to get outside with her, but shes super slow and just wants to go back inside most of the time.

Also, I want to have her meals cooked fresh (ground turkey and pumpkin or something like that) because of her lack of teeth.","This post is about a rat terrier named Bella, who is an older dog with a declining health condition.

Hey. I'm writing a travel guide about Buenos Aires because all the mainstream ones there are aren't good and because I think that it would be fun if there was a guide written by an actual local.

Hello everyone,

The next summer I will be traveling with my brother, mom and dad from West Canada to East Canada with a camper. We got family in Canada which we wish to visit while traveling from west to east. We are starting at Vancouver then head towards Calgary to meet an uncle of mine and then continue our journey to Toronto which is also our final destination. In Toronto I got a lot more family. We also wish to travel through the Rocky Mountains as that is something we really wish to see.

Other than that we still have no clue what we should visit. I did some research and found a couple of interesting places but I don't know if it is actually worth going to so I decided to ask in here. I have been following this subreddit for quite some time and always enjoy reading the stories and advices people give here. 

So now I am wondering if people who have done this before know where we should have a look. I am really excited to visit Canada, I think it is a gorgeous country but I really want to get the most out of it.

**Some details:**

**Start:** Vancouver

**Guaranteed Stop at:** Calgary

**End:** Toronto

I'm sure these types of posts crop of from time to time, so I apologize if you've seen this all before.

I'm looking for a little advice.  To begin, I'll give you some background information.  I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force.  While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations.  I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have.  I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology.  I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010.  I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010.  I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers.  I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money.  I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking.  I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS?  A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

Thanks in advance; sorry for the wall of text.","This individual has a unique background with a military service history, an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies, and a brief stint in a bakery.

My employer announced today that they sold the company. They passed out the new employment contracts and there are some awful no-compete and IP sections (everything you do outside the office belongs to the company regardless).

Not long ago we got a great dane puppy who just recently turned 4 months. Beginning of last week we started noticing that he seemed to be having issues defecating. Was just getting a slight runny crap. Figured he had an upset stomache and waited a day. Next day he was having that issue as well as puking up a meal. After puking the next day we took him in. The vet initially thought it was a GI tract infection and sent us home with some antibiotics and a few others. Told us to come back if he continued to puke. That night.. he puked again.
Took him back to the vet who ran xrays. Other than being able to tell that his intestines were bloated it didn't show anything actually stuck. We were at a point where they quoted me at $1200 - $1900 to do an exploratory surgery to see what the issue is. We're no rich couple and thats a LOT of money for us but we couldn't let him die. They cut into him at noon yesterday. Ended up being [intussusception] Apparently the intestines fold in on itself like a pirates telescope causing blockage and soon followed by death.

In June of 2015 I was laid off from my job. I was lucky enough to be paid out through the end of August and collected unemployment thereafter. Unfortunately, prior to being laid off I had a lot of medical issues (2 endoscopies, an ambulance ride, and a colonoscopy) so needless to say the lay off was really bad timing.

Well, I thought I was being careful, but here I am, confessing at the altar of Runnit, a runner's greatest sin: impatience.

A week ago Sunday I went out for a 4 mile run as I am currently in the middle of a 10k training program. I started the run with what felt like a tight left glute, but I wasn't concerned. By mile 3 I was feeling some pain in my left hip (nothing super concerning), but finished my 4 miles because it had taken a lot of mental fortitude and willpower to get out there that day and I wanted to finish.

I hobbled home and did some massage and stretching. Decided to rest up and heal. I skipped my scheduled Tuesday 3.5 mile, then the Thursday 2 mile, and now here I am going to skip my scheduled 4 mile run again because the pain hasn't really gone away. It's a dull, achey, pinching pain, maybe a 3 to 4 on the pain scale? Feels deep, but not in the actual joint itself.

I've never experienced a sports injury like this before, and so I'm here wondering when and if you would see a doctor about this.

Back story: I am a 26 year old male who has fallen in love with running. In September of last year my house was flooded. It was obviously a stressful time for my wife and me. We had to stay with her parents while we sorted out our mess of a house. Long story short between gutting our old house, selling it, buying a new one, and living with her parents and eating her mom's cooking and tons of restaurant meals I packed on some extra gut weight.

Those pictures show where I was when we moved into the new house and where I am now. I started running seriously around May. I have been gradually increasing my mileage since then to about 80 miles a month with an average of 20 a week. I would like to keep bumping that up but it seems like the weight loss I am experiencing is taking from places I would rather not lose. My chest, shoulders and arms are getting to be a little skeletorish for my liking and when I run into people I haven't seen for a while they ask if I have been sick.

So if you are still reading the question I have for you all is if you have any recommendations for a good weight training plan to complement my running that would help add back a little bulk? Also as far as diet goes should I be increasing my caloric intake? I get around 2000 a day from nuts, lunch meat, pastas, and chicken or pork for supper.

We rescued a Staffordshire Bull Terrier from a shelter ~6 months ago, when we got her she had a broken leg and was visibly skinny. 6 Months later she has put a lot of weight on and is a very energetic young dog (she is approx. 11 months old now) however, while searching online i find the ideal weight for bitches of her breed is 10~16kg, she weighs 16.5kg and her ribs are still *just* visible when you look at her.

My wife does the bulk of the driving and there's nothing I can do about it.  I have epilepsy and even though my driving record is just as good as hers, it's just safer for everyone that I don't drive.  That goes double for when my kids are in the car.  She regularly goes 20 mph over the speed limit, will swerve through three lanes just to get ahead of one car, and then rides the bumper of the next car in line.  When the light turns green she either takes off like it's a drag race or doesn't notice the light has changed until someone honks.  When a light turns red she accelerates until she is forced to slam on the brakes.  When I drive the SUV I get about 22 mpg.  When she drives she gets about 16 mpg.  

We've fought about this more times than I can count and she always calms down for a month or two.  Then she inevitably goes back to driving like she's sponsored by Marlboro.  The biggest problem I'm facing, and the reason I'm never going to win this fight (other than that she's my wife) is that she always knows exactly where everyone else is on the road.  She has perfect spatial awareness.  I'm at a loss as to what to do and need some new arguments to get her to slow down.

Currently I am out of a job for about a month after 3 long years working for a major retail company. I am planning to stay far away from retail at least for now and am finally ready to hunker down and apply. Yay!

I live north of Portland, OR where the most beautiful establishment i could possibly think of is about to become a reality.
Purrington's Cat Lounge.

This place is literally perfect for me, with a cafe' that sells beer and wine, yummy foods, and has a lounge to be filled with CATS.

Disclaimer: sorry if this falls into the mediocre and vague category of questions, but I don't know how else to put it.

I'm a recent graduate, came out of uni in the UK last year. Haven't found anything I really want to do with my life yet in terms of a career, so have been muddling along in a call centre for the time being. With respect to this question, it probably doesn't help that my university (Oxford) is really the kind of place that holds your hand - at least in terms of providing accommodation, food etc. 

I'm sure that I want to travel and see the world, especially now that I'm in a time of transition, but I cannot even begin to imagine where to start. Every time my mind returns to the subject, and starts to think about the impossible complexity of the world outside my small country, I am hit with almost a sense of dread. Part of that dread is, I suspect, the worry that I will never pluck up the courage/resolve/whatever to actually do it. 

Don't misunderstand me, I have been abroad - many times. However, it has been exclusively in Europe, and only on what would be called holidays rather than 'travel'. 
When I hear or read about people going away for long periods of time, like a year or more, I wonder how can they do it? Does it cost enormous sums of money (which I lack)? Do they work while away? If so how on Earth does one organise such a thing? Down to even the basics, how do they choose where to go, how to move between places, everything.

I've been ""trying"" really hard to start my college education this past year, but I'm very stuck due to not being able to obtain all of my transcripts. I was able to obtain my high school transcript and ACT scores from 2009 relatively painlessly, however, I'm having NO luck in retrieving my cosmetology(Paul Mitchell the School)s transcript to be sent to universities I'm interested in. I have contacted PMTS repeatedly without being able to get in touch with anyone in admissions, until finally I was informed that I needed to contact someone else entirely.

*deep breath* So I did. 

I spoke with a man who said that he would be able to send out my transcript, however he noticed that I had an outstanding balance of 40k or some outlandish sum of money, to which I made it known that I was COMPLETELY unaware of. He added that I should have been sent to collections by now, that it was a ""school fee"" that would not be covered by financial aid.
I asked him to elaborate so he said he would send me more information on it, then instructed me to send him an email with the address of the university I wish to have my transcripts sent to. 

And I never heard back. 

I did not complete my degree at PMTS, I dropped out at about 400+/- hours. I'm having a hard time understanding why those transcripts are even necessary to continue my education if I start out as a freshman anyway. But...

I NEED MY TRANSCRIPT GOSH DARN IT!

Hello,

Background info on myself - I'm a fresh college grad looking for a first credit card away from my parents. I have a credit score of 789 (according to Chase, who declined my credit card application, 785 according to my most recent inquiry on creditkarma). I have had a credit card in my name for the last 11 years with a $6500 spending limit that I have been using for gas and small purchases, which is paid off in full every month by my parents, so I don't have any late payments on my credit score. I also have a student loan on my credit report, which has been paid off within the 6-mo no interest grace period. 

Background on the situation - I was pre-approved for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card about a month ago when I opened a bank account. 2 weeks ago I applied online, and a week ago I was denied for ""Few revolving accounts opened long enough to establish credit history, Not enough accounts opened long enough to establish a credit history.""     My understanding is that these reasons basically mean I haven't had credit history for long enough. Which is very strange considering I was pre-approved, nothing new has come up in my credit report since then, and I've had a decent sized spending limit credit card opened for 11 years, and a loan which had been opened for a few years.

My question is - Is it worth it to contact Chase for more information? Is it possible that there was some sort of mistake? Or is normal for someone of my credit record?

Side question - If there's no point in contacting Chase about it, what are some other cards you might recommend? I was looking at the Capital One Venture Rewards card or the CO VentureOne Rewards Card.","This individual has a solid credit history with a high score, a paid-off student loan, and a history of responsible credit card use, making them a potentially good candidate for a new card.

Alright so background  
-Im a 25 year old male   
-Making $45k before tax/bonus.   
-Around March/April of 2014 i got a DUI, i could go into my story or excuse but wont, entered into a plea with the court in may 2015.

The 350z is a fun car but i want to change because A. I want something more practical with ipod hookup, side curtain airbags, rear view camera, traction control, be able to fit more than two people etc. and B. Pretty sure I'm paying $1850 a year for liability atm....   

Even though normally i would look to get a gently used car a couple years old, I really want to get a car with autonomous features like auto braking or lane control etc. was looking at the new 2016 civic.  

Or was looking at 2013 accord, just to give an idea. Want something safe, reliable, well rated. etc.   

I have 5k cash and got a carmax estimate at $7k for the 350z, might be able to find one of those used dealers who offer $500-$1000 over carmax offer but thats what i have to put towards new car. 

Is a 2016 civic or 2013 accord a bad idea or out of my range? I want something decent that i can drive for a while but know im kinda more limited in everything i can do because of my DUI.

And no, I don't experiment on my dogs.

My wife and I have fostered and rescued around 20 dogs over the past 8 years. We have 3 dogs that are ours, and right now we're dogsitting for my sister (who adopted our first real rescue.) We're also dogsitting for a friend of ours who adopted 3 of our rescues who had to take an emergency business trip to Columbia (and no, not for that white powder type of business.)

So right now we have 7 dogs in our house, but we've done that once before and can handle it.

The real story comes from last summer, when we rescued a mom and her pup from the crawl space of a house that was due to be demolished later that week. We kept the pup, who is one of our core three, and the mom went to live with our friend, and is one of the 4 we're now dogsitting.

The mom is some kind of husky/akita mix, but is relatively small for her size, coming in around 50 pounds. The son has that in him, as well as 50% German Shepherd and is huge, almost 100 lbs. 

What's amazing is that we've had this pup since he was 3 months and we haven't had mom around in a year. Up until we had them domesticated, both dogs were essentially feral. 

The similarities in how they behave is uncanny; the way they reach out for affection, how to crawl onto the bed to cuddle, nuzzle up for a pet, and follow us around to make sure we're OK. It's all identical and different than how our other dogs act.","This post describes a family that has fostered and rescued a large group of dogs, including a husky/akita mix and a large German Shepherd, and has been successfully raising them in a domestic environment.

Hey all, recent incidents got me thinking.

I live in the suburbs of Chicago, right outside the city limit. My city is pretty nice, but there are some iffy surrounding areas. My girlfriend and I rented out a condo from the owner last May and it's been great so far, aside from a couple incidents that got me thinking.

In early August, I bought a Nexus 7, worth about $300 bucks with shipping and had it delivered to the condo. The UPS guy dropped it off in the foyer. It was swiped by the time my girlfriend got home, two hours later. I talked with the woman who signed for it and concluded that she received a package at the same time (verified) and the UPS guy applied her signature to my package. She told me that stolen packages are pretty common in this complex. Called UPS, they're still working it out, but my credit card company has already refunded me my money. Lesson learned.

Right after that, the labels on our mailbox were ripped off. They were flimsy cellophane taped on, so I thought maybe they just fell off. We got a label maker and put them on again. Ripped off again within two days, though whoever did it obviously struggled with the one on the buzzer, half of it is still attached. I don't know what purpose this would have, but there you have it.

Third incident was last night. I do karate Monday and Wednesday nights, and my girlfriend went to bed around 9pm. I get home around 940 and in a half asleep daze, she tells me she was hearing strange noises. Apparently after she went to bed she heard someone rattling the doorknob, loud enough for the cat to jump up and run towards the door (she's a energetic cat though). I fall asleep and figure she was just half-asleep. 

This morning I talk to her a little bit more, think about all three incidents, and wonder if something else is going on. We have renter's insurance and thankfully our schedules work out so she's home in the mornings and I'm home in the evenings. We've contacted the landlord and he said he'll be in contact with a few other owners in the same building.

Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am having a bit of an anxiety fit over my current situation. If there is a more appropriate sub, please direct me to it.

I recently graduated from a specialized technical program and since graduating have had a ridiculous number of job offers and interview requests. I have actually turned down a number of interviews. 

I had a job lined up several months ago, but it was honestly not something I was very enthusiastic about, I only took the offer because they were the first to contact me and I was not sure what the job market in my field was like. We'll call then company A.

Long story short, I interviewed with another company last week, let's call them company B, and they exceeded all expectations and are basically a dream come true. They paid for my flight to their facility for the interview, put me up in a hotel and paid for a rental car. I had also previously turned in my notice with my current employer at the time, because company A, which I had already accepted an offer from, had expected me to start this coming week. I left the interview with company B feeling confident but without any offer in hand. Fast forward to today, I have notified company A that I won't be able to start with them and so am officially unemployed and awaiting some word from company B.

Am I insane to expect that company B is going to make some kind of offer? Should I be scrambling to find something solid? I have enough funds to keep me going for a few months if absolutely necessary.

A little context:

Her and I have known each other for about 4 years.  We met in college.  Had classes together.  Had a short fling while her and her boyfriend were taking a break.  Now we work together (I got her the job), and we share an office.  Really good friends, I've always had strong feelings towards her.  I have a girlfriend of 3 years, she's back with her boyfriend of 10 years.

We also went to school with this guy, lets call him Roy.  Roy sucked, he was immature, inconsiderate, just unlikable all around.  Roy and my friend (lets call her Joyce) maintained a friendship, one I never really understood.

A few months ago, she told me Roy was being stalker-y and wouldn't leave her alone.  I always knew Roy had a huge crush on her, and I told her to just cut off contact.  This went on and on for a while.  Now she said he's better and not bothering her.  Fine.

Today I'm alone at my office.  She took the day off.  No one is around.  I noticed some of her journals she left behind.  I know I'm awful for doing it, but I decided to read some of the entries.  I still have feelings for her and I was wondering if I appeared in any of them.

Literally nothing but pages and pages of her describing her attraction to Roy.  Pages and pages going on and on about how much she likes him, times they've kissed, etc.  I can't fucking believe it.  To boot, I found an entry saying ""Roy isn't Awfulfriend4o9, he isn't easy to manipulate..."".  Awesome.  I feel like dirt.

I'm shaking with anger and shame.","This post is a deeply unsettling account of a woman's intense obsession with her ex-boyfriend, Roy, documented in her journals.

Like with all of my threads, if there is any info you would like to know, just feel free to comment, I love answering questions.

Basic info:Live in South Carolina, out in the country, and make 8 dollars an hour doing clean-up work.

This might just be me overthinking things, and possibly making it sound worse than it is, but do you guys have any advice for someone who wasn't able to save any cash/work until he was 19?

i'm trying to put as much away as I can, taking as many side jobs/yards as I can handle, but I feel like it might not be enough. I do plan on doing some self investing (i.e. college) but not sure if I should start looking to do some actual investing (for example, mutual funds and the like)

In any case, I don't have any small/medium purchases, and some people and friends suggested a money market account for the time being, since i don't plan on doing anything too crazy.

I know a lot of people will say, Look at the sidebar! And you would be right, but I just like asking around for more personalized advice.

For anyone who'se curious, the reason I wasn't able to work/save money involves a parent who I no talk to, and their annoying tendency to raid my bank account for stuff she didn't need. Which is why I just gave up, and decided to focus all of my spare time into schoolwork.

Now that this is over, I currently make 8 or so dollars an hour, have about 350-360 USD in the bank, and not sure what to do with it.

So I've known this girl for a about 4 months now and helped her through a breakup...or at least what I thought was a breakup. She has cried to me down the phone about 5 times, saying how much of a dick this guy was and she doesn't know why she still likes him. He treated her like shit but she still kept speaking to him and still does to this day albeit slightly less. 
So when they *broke up* she was extremely happy and we went to my friends house and had a good night. Long story short we ended up kissing and I thought everything was going to be good. So we get speaking and we go for days out and spend nights together with my friends but nothing else has happened since the first kiss which I don't mind since she has just gone through a breakup and I know it takes time. But as we speak on the phone she keeps mentioning how her Ex is messaging her saying he misses her and how she should go to his house.

I am 30 years old and I reside in Pennsylvania. I was never all that responsible with my credit, I admit to it. I was a dumb kid and it's hurting me as an adult. At one point I was almost debt free, and then I got sick. I've been dealing with a chronic medical condition for about 3 years and it's not only sucking the life out of me, but it's really putting me in a bad financial situation. It all goes back to those damn credit cards. I got to a point where all of my money was going to medical bills just to keep me out of collections that I was putting all of my everyday expenses on credit cards (mostly food and gas.)

The Starbucks crowd can act really entitled, but there's no one worse than this 60+ year old regular.  Let's call him Bill.

Bill and I like sitting in the same corner.  I don't know why he does, but I do because it has space for me to put my stuff where it's out of everyone's way and not taking up a chair - it allows me to be considerate.  When I get to Starbucks first, I sit there.  Bill was so openly aggressive about it that I finally just sat somewhere else until he left and switched seats.

But an asshole is still an asshole, and he'd be aggressive towards me no matter where I sat.  Not to mention, I come everyday and he doesn't, so there are days I'm trying to be considerate and ultimately end up losing out on the seat I like to a third party.  But whatever, it's a seat - I don't own seats in Starbucks and I'm not going to make a fuss about it because I'm a grown up.

Well, after Bill didn't show up two days this week, I decided I'm not waiting for him to have his seat, and he can grow up about it.  He is about 40 years my senior, and there's no reason I should be more mature than him - girls don't mature *that* much faster than boys.  Today I was ordering a bagel - yes, I order as cheap as I can when I'm here - and he saw me and called me a bitch.  And he always throws comments my way, but that was unfairly harsh.  I have done nothing to him other than like the same damn seat and finally had enough of letting him dictate my sitting habits.

I'm starting to bet Bill was raised as an only child and never had kids of his own, because he has 0 signs of maturity despite how old he is.  High road or low, he bitches at me for existing, and I'm not letting him drive me away.

I recently moved into a new house. From the sale of my old house, I will receive about $10,000 that didn't go into the down payment of the new house. I originally planned on putting that towards my student loan but I am now looking at using it towards solar panels for my house. Financing on the solar panels (about 16k) is 6.5% while my two loans (16,000k at 3.5% variable rate and 19.5k at 4.75%).

Her dog has been with her since it was 8 weeks old. He is always at her side and she spoils him.

He also has the bad habit of begging for food when we are eating because she gives him food from her plate. She believes dogs in nature just expect humans to share food with them and she is completely okay with letting him lick the plates and bowls clean ""if he didn't beg"". Which just means if he lays by her feet and stares at her, she will eventually give him food. How can I break this behavior?

He also doesn't use his dog bed to sleep in, instead he humps it. And she allows him to hump it. He humps sheets, pillows, anything and she doesn't scold him at all. I'm afraid to get a cat because he might start humping it.

Upon the front door opening he makes a break for it. He doesn't wait, doesn't hesitate. And just runs for it, which makes me afraid I might come home from work and he will run out and I'd have to chase him down.

He also barks randomly at random times even after being let out or played with. It's quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and he is barking up a storm and scratching the bed I'm sleeping on.

He sleeps on top of the couch and I try to make sure he stays off the furniture but according to her "" thats just what he does""

My dog is a one and a half years old mutt. He's been strugling with bad skin problems ever since he was a baby..

Throw-away here. My ex-boyfriend and I bought a dog together when we were together. We broke up January of 2012 and I received custody of her. We adopted her when she was just 8 weeks old. I've been toying with the idea of putting her up for adoption since we broke up because I feel like I cannot care for her like I used to when I was living with me ex. I would let him have her, except for the fact that he is a sociopath and we did not exactly have a healthy relationship. 

I've been living on my own since July of 2012. I feel pretty disconnected towards her, and seem to be getting angry with her.

Hey /R/unnit,

Just wanted to follow up and post a race report for the Yellowknife Overlander Marathon (which was my first ever marathon) that I finished today!

After running my first half 6 weeks ago and getting 3 weeks of training before my taper I was woefully underprepared but I set out only to finish. My final time was 4 hours and 20 something minutes, I sadly was so caught up in the moment that I didn't take a look at the clock but I will get my results in the next week.

I woke up at 5 AM today and had my usual long run breakfast of a bagel + energy drink. The weather was between 10-20 celsius, gradually warming up as the time ticked on, but very bearable with the overcast and wind. 

Miles 1-13: Fairly uneventful and basically was just warming up at a 10 minute pace or slower, minor irritants like my foot getting a pinch on every step (nothing painful I could just feel it) and my stomach being grumbly.

MIles 13-20: At this point I was starting to feel a bit of fatigue as the miles started to pile on. Around mile 13.5 I got a major cramp in my foot and I had to retie my shoe way tighter which alleviated the issue for the most part. At mile 16 I had to use the washroom really bad and was lucky to snag a toilet out on the route (these were spread out very few and far between) which saved my ass when I felt I was going to burst.

20-24: At this point I felt I had good energy but the wear and tear on my muscles was reaching new levels. Hips, my left knee, my feet, my nips, hamstring were all seizing up and it was some of the most mentally challenging parts of the race.  

24-26: Flat ground and smooth sailing, I was sort of hobbling to make it back but I never walked once!

My family is headed to Brazil for the World Cup this summer and we're starting to set our itinerary. Here is what we know (pretty much revolves around where we have tickets):

- Salvador for the Germany v Portugal game on 6/16
- Fortaleza for Germany v Ghana on 6/21
- (Probably) Recife for Germany v USA on 6/26

We don't know where we'll be for the round of 16 and quarterfinal games, but it looks like we'll be moving around between Sao Paulo, Brasilia, and Rio starting July 1.  Our plans also will include Iguazu Falls at some point.

**What I'm asking**

- Are there any must-sees in the country that I'm missing?
- What might be some good, interesting day trips I can take from any of those cities?  We like outdoorsy hiking type activities, beautiful landscapes and wildlife, interesting cultural anecdotes, good food...
- What are some hidden gems in any of those cities (like good restaurants, market places, neighborhoods) that may not show up in a travel book?
- Logistical advice on getting around, what to look for in choosing hotels (like which neighborhoods?), etc.  We saw that there is a Brazil air pass which we will probably purchase, but any other thoughts are welcome.

I've ordered the NatGeo travel book, Fodor's Brazil 2014 (World Cup edition), as well as Fodor's: Rio, Best 25.  If I'm missing a good one, let me know!

No specific budget, but let's keep it reasonable :)

Thank you!

Dear PF,

One of my goals in the coming year is to understand and maximize my monetary situation.  I currently have only school and car debt, which, combined, is less than $45k (~$40k school, ~$2k car).  I have a solid job, where I currently make ~$70k/year, and I expect a 2-6%/year increase (not including bonus pay, and promotional salary increases), and I have a decent credit score (last check was a few months ago; 750).

I am not against reading to understand my finances for myself, and being able to understand and maximize them is one of my long term goals.  I'm concerned that with my current income, situation, and lack of understanding, that I won't be doing myself the *most* good on my own.   Is it worth the while (ever) to pay someone to interpret and explain your finances to you?  

I'm not against working with someone at fee to learn about these things, or even letting someone else manage a portion of my finances fully in order to help maximize them.  I am concerned with where one goes to get that sort of advice or information, and if it's a useful investment.  Other than 'self teaching', I wouldn't know where to turn for financial planning advice- my CU? My parents in another state? Their financial planner? Peers in this state? Co-workers?","This person is seeking advice on how to improve their financial situation, recognizing their current debt burden and income potential.

Warning: long

I used to be a good kid. I had good grades. I told very few lies and I was respectful to everyone. I don't know what triggered it. It's like the part of my brain that made me care about stuff stopped working. I started getting bad grades in school. I mean like really bad. I was lucky enough not to get summer school but i still did awful. The worst part is that they spent a lot of money on tutoring lessons for an ap exam and i ended up getting a 2. I also cheated alot on tests. I started lying to my parents and told them i was studying when i was doing other stuff. Then when they started seeing a decline in grades they grounded me. I would usually learn my lesson and pull myself out of situations like these but i didnt this time. I kept doing bad stuff and I started disrespecting my own parents and my siblings who were just trying to help me. I eventually lost most of my friends and i put on a huge amount of weight and I started doing bad things.

Good morning Reddit! 

My fiancé and I are having an issue. About 3 years ago we were very good friend with another husband and wife couple, Amy and Craig. They were on vacation with us in Vegas when my fiancé proposed and all was well. Amy was set to be my maid of honor. 

After we get back from vacation, Craig wants to buy Amy a new wedding ring for their anniversary. They married young and she had a very small ring, and he could now afford a larger one. He went and applied for credit at a local chain jewelry store, but was told he needed a co-signer in order to be approved. He asked my fiancé, who agreed. Not ever knowing we would ever have an issue. Craig's payments were only $75 a month, but was for a 5 year interest free loan. 

Fast forward two and a half years later. We have fallen out with the couple due to their selfish behavior. Since the fallout they have made 1 late payment. My fiancé called and told Craig to take care of it and not to let it happen again. Until yesterday, they made the rest of the payments on time. Yesterday my fiancé received another call about 2 late payments on the account. This is now killing my fiancés credit, with 3 late payments on his credit that aren't even his! We are in the process of trying to save for a house and plan to apply for a loan soon. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET THIS LOAN OFF OF HIS CREDIT/OUT OF HIS NAME???","This couple's situation is a concerning example of how a seemingly harmless request for a larger wedding ring can lead to a devastating financial crisis and damage a person's credit.

I'm making this because I just got an email from a recruiter about a potential other position, which I don't plan to interview for since I only worked at my company for 3 months so far.

The problem is that for being a big company, there just doesn't seem to be any way I can think of of moving up in the company. I spoke to my bosses and asked around, but all I got from them was the standard ""Learn about the industry"" answer. I look at people in my department, all older than me by about 20-25 years, all seem to have just gotten a change in title without any real authority or sense of moving up. 

Every time I speak to my dad about it, he says to me ""I want you to have a plan"" and when I try to explain all of this to him, he gets upset and repeats that he doesn't know what I do. I have some type of plan but it really doesn't involve staying at this company because I just don't see an opportunity to grow unless I go into another division of the company since it's such a large company (though I don't see many opportunities at the moment for other divisions). 

Now, this part isn't really pertinent to anything but, my dad and I got into the dumbest argument about salary. He claims that people talk and everyone in my department knows how much I make/how much the other people in the department make. I'm trying to argue that it's not true and only management/HR knows. My dad comes from a stock market background where everyone basically has an idea how much other people make based on clientele and it seems that he just thinks snooping around for a person's salary is appropriate conversation or something. He even claims that a person should ask about salary in the interview, which I disagree with unless it's brought up by the interviewer.",This post expresses a frustration with a large company where the individual feels they have limited opportunities for advancement and is struggling to have a productive conversation with their father about salary.

Why do  keep putting myself out there and trying to help people and actually care? For the most part people are just using me to get something. 
Everyone just looks out for themselves. I'm tired of it. People are greedy and will pretend to care just to get what they want. 
It's been this way my whole life it seems. This is why I shut down and close myself off from people. 

I'm not so jaded as to cut myself off from everyone forever, but I'm going to be more careful. And I AM going to take a few days for myself. I'm going to be ""selfish"" for a 2 or 3 days and not bother with anyone. Cut off communication for the most par. Just kind of whatever. 

I keep falling into the same trap. Though this time it wasn't as harsh as previous times and didn't last as long. It only being ""online people"" that I haven't known long makes it better in some ways but makes me feel a bit more dumb for putting myself out there like I did.

Hello fellow PF redditors, I received a notice of tax deficiency from 2012 in the amount of $2,074.  That year my ex-wife and I each had one 1099 to our names that were not properly filed.  The notice includes the 1099 amounts and corresponding social security #s.

I'll sum this up best I can. To start, and what was probably a bad idea to begin with, I got involved with a girl online. Talked to her for a few months, ended up caring about her. She felt the same way so we became an item. Had a great time, perfect happy little couple and all. The only flaw was that there was a great distance. No ocean or anything; just lots of land. Cue to around the end. She confesses that she cheated on me by being drunk one night, letting a drunk guy friend come check on her (she's at a university), and he kissed her, she kissed back, they fingered/handjob until I guess she realized what was happening and stopped. After talking to a mutual friend for a few days, I took her back mainly because I love(d) her, I'm co-dependent, and I have no other options.

Cue to last week. It doesn't take us a week back together before she blows up (bad temper problems) and we have our worst fight yet. As much as I hated to, I ended it. It hurts me just as much as it may have hurt her by the way she acted. Today, I find out that the mutual friend from before had asked for a chance with her in case we broke up and she agreed (he actually is across an ocean). He's also told a friend of mine and even myself that he'd fuck her, how hot she is, all this stuff. It honestly disgusts me and makes my stomach cramp when I think about it. I'd like to get over it but I'm just a boring guy who stays at home all day except for class and I don't exactly have options to get my mind off things.","This person experienced a disastrous relationship with a girl who cheated on them, leading to a devastating fight and a concerning situation involving a mutual friend and a potential for further exploitation.
